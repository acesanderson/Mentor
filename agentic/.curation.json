How do we sell it?  \\n And where do we go for support?  \\n You'll hear me refer to the sales tasks  \\n throughout the rest of this course  \\n because it's such a critical component  \\n of your success as a sales manager.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

What do we sell?  \\n How do we sell it?  \\n And where do we go for support?  \\n With the new world of work and virtual technologies,  \\n you have more opportunities than ever  \\n to create an effective sales task.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3046199\",\"duration\":161,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Conducting virtual competency programs\",\"fileName\":\"3005391_en_US_05_02_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Salespeople need knowledge, skills, and dispositions to succeed at accomplishing the sales task.

 \\n Well, there are a few things  \\n that make for a great salesperson  \\n that can actually get in the way  \\n of sales management success.  \\n First off, as a salesperson,  \\n you know how you did it and how you did it worked.  \\n That's why you're here.  \\n But keep in mind,  \\n there are a lot of different sales approaches  \\n that are effective for a variety of sales people.  \\n So be open minded.  \\n You're not trying to create a team of clones.  \\n You want a diverse team that will win business.  \\n You know, the second thing that often happens  \\n to new managers is you may be annoyed by the amount  \\n of administrative work that you've just come into.  \\n Being in the field can be exhilarating.  \\n Being chained to email, not so much.  \\n If you are a gregarious expert,  \\n you're going to have to create systems  \\n for handling admin work.  \\n Now the last reason great sales people  \\n often don't translate into great sales managers,  \\n and this is one of the hardest lessons to learn,  \\n is there are a lot of differences in skills.  \\n You were promoted because you're good.  \\n Maybe you're even great  \\n and your expectations are probably very high.  \\n This is a good thing, but you need to recognize  \\n not everyone is going to have your same level of performance.  \\n You know, one of the surprises that many new managers  \\n discover and it's not a very pleasant surprise is,  \\n there are a lot of variations in performance.  \\n Things that you assumed were standard sometimes aren't  \\n but don't get discouraged.  \\n If you're thinking right now,  \\n \\\"Oh my gosh, I'm in over my head.  \\n \\\"Why am I even here?\\\"  \\n Relax.  \\n Odds are, if you up skill yourself on just a few things,  \\n you can be successful.  \\n Now they might not come as naturally to you  \\n as your last sales position, but you can do this.  \\n The fact that you recognize that you have some challenges  \\n and that you're here in this course proactively  \\n trying to improve,  \\n well that alone will put you ahead  \\n of the majority of sales managers,  \\n some of who may have even been in this position  \\n longer than you.  \\n So let's talk about what you can do  \\n to combat the challenges that I just mentioned.  \\n So the first thing is to remember that the enthusiasm  \\n that won you customers may not have the same effect  \\n on your team.  \\n I want you to think about some of your best bosses.  \\n They're excited, yes.  \\n They're also even tempered and levelheaded.  \\n So your job as a leader is part pep rally,  \\n but it actually goes beyond that,  \\n because see, your team is going to look to you  \\n as a calming force, as someone who knows  \\n how to handle challenges.  \\n So focus on reading situations and recognize  \\n an upbeat attitude can be good,  \\n but being too over the top, it can be exhausting,  \\n especially if you have some more introverted people  \\n on your team.  \\n Now, the second thing is, focus on the fact  \\n that this is a very different role.  \\n There's going to be administrative work.  \\n You know, when you started your sales career,  \\n there were probably some aspects of the job  \\n that you didn't absolutely love.  \\n So when it comes to admin work, find someone, a peer,  \\n someone who is good at getting these types of things done  \\n and ask them for tips.  \\n Because you see, you have the opportunity to create  \\n a killer sales team and you could add more value  \\n to a larger group of customers.  \\n So you want to get the admin part of your job done  \\n as painlessly as possible.  \\n And the last thing,  \\n when you look at the performance of your team,  \\n one of the things that you want to make sure you do  \\n is schedule enough open time in your day to coach them.  \\n According to Refugee, companies with reps  \\n who receive less than 30 minutes of coaching a week,  \\n have a win rate of 43%.  \\n But companies where reps are coached  \\n more than two hours a week, have a win rate of 56%.  \\n So do the math on your team and figure out  \\n the way that would affect you.  \\n It's huge.  \\n So as a new sales manager, set high expectations,  \\n make them clear, but don't make the rookie mistake  \\n of being easily frustrated.  \\n Coach your team, be constructive and be patient.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3099340\",\"duration\":197,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Embracing your sales manager role\",\"fileName\":\"520214_en_US_01_03_2022Q3_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about the skills necessary to become a good leader.

I'm excited.  \\n How do you feel about the value story?  \\n - It's really strong.  \\n I mean, he came to us through the website  \\n and he was already on top of it.  \\n - Okay, good.  \\n that you think would make it stronger?  \\n - I don't think so, I mean, he's the decision maker.  \\n We've talked a lot about his goals.  \\n I think it's going to close.  \\n - Okay, that sounds really good,  \\n and I see you've got a couple of others here  \\n on your 30 day horizon.  \\n - It's going to be a good month.  \\n - (laughs) That's great.  \\n I'm excited for you.  \\n So let me ask about the things  \\n that are a little further away, 120, 180 days.  \\n What have you got going on there?  \\n - You mean like my other prospects?  \\n - Well, no, not so much the other prospects,  \\n but one of the things I noticed  \\n is you've done a great job of working these deals  \\n all the way through,  \\n but I'm curious if you have any leads that you're nurturing.  \\n - Oh, yeah.  \\n I've been kind of softly introducing myself,  \\n sent some articles,  \\n asked a few questions about their business.  \\n - Okay, I think that's really good.  \\n When I look at what you've got going on now,  \\n you spent a good bit of time nurturing those  \\n to get 'em here.  \\n How much time are you spending  \\n nurturing the current leads that you have?  \\n - Probably about an hour a week.  \\n I usually just do it Friday afternoon.  \\n - Okay, does that feel appropriate to you,  \\n or do you want to, you know, maybe consider upping that?  \\n - I think I could add some more time earlier in the week.  \\n I don't think it would hurt in the long run.  \\n - Yeah, I think that's a really good idea,  \\n 'cause I think you're doing a good job adding value early,  \\n and when I look at the strong month  \\n that you're probably going to have.  \\n it's a result of what you did about six months ago.  \\n - Good point.  \\n - Yeah, so I want you to keep applying that effort.  \\n So you don't want to end up with a big goose egg  \\n at the end of the year.  \\n - (laughs) Right.  \\n - So last quick question.  \\n I'm looking at your customers here.  \\n How much time are you spending reaching out to them?  \\n - It kind of depends.  \\n I mean, they usually call me when they have questions,  \\n and that's just the relationship we've always had,  \\n but they're good, they know the product.  \\n - Yeah, I think that's true,  \\n and you do have a really good relationship  \\n with your existing customers.  \\n You know, as I'm thinking about this,  \\n one of the things, I mean,  \\n we were caught off guard last year  \\n 'cause we lost a few customers, not yours, but others,  \\n and so I want to make sure that everybody's  \\n really shoring up their relationship  \\n with the existing customers.  \\n Is there something you could do with them,  \\n to like be more proactive and reach out?  \\n - Yeah, I mean, we have a few new training tools  \\n that I think would help them on some newer features,  \\n and even just checking in with them,  \\n making sure they don't have questions.  \\n - Okay, I think that's a really good idea.  \\n I mean, I think you're going to have a great month.  \\n I just want to make sure that what you got  \\n on either side of it is really well balanced,  \\n so you have a really good year.  \\n - Thanks, me too.  \\n - Did you notice how each piece of the pipeline  \\n had a different set of questions  \\n that the manager asked the rep,  \\n yet they're all focused  \\n on that same through line, customer impact.  \\n As a new manager, you might discover  \\n that some of your reps have pie in the sky pipelines.  \\n They're never going to close everything  \\n that they're forecasting.  \\n If you're having a panic moment right now,  \\n thinking oh my gosh, I'm not sure we have a good pipeline,  \\n or even worse, we don't have a pipeline, breathe.  \\n Have you ever heard the expression,  \\n the best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago,  \\n but the second best time is right now?  \\n So as a manager, just make an effort  \\n to ensure you have enough leads in your team's pipeline,  \\n and remember not to neglect those leads  \\n when they turn into prospects, and customers.  \\n Know what to measure.  \\n Talk about every area of the pipeline with your reps,  \\n and communicate the big picture.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3099341\",\"duration\":135,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Coaching sales skills\",\"fileName\":\"520214_en_US_02_03_2022Q3_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about the difference between sales skills coaching and sales assisting.

 \\n - Well, you guys have the best comp plan in the business,  \\n so here I am.  \\n - Yes, that we do.  \\n So do you anticipate a very big learning curve?  \\n - I don't anticipate one at all.  \\n I mean, software is software.  \\n I can do it.  \\n - Okay, well that sounds really good.  \\n Now let's look at Elizabeth  \\n playing a different type of person.  \\n So Elizabeth, tell me,  \\n what about this job was interesting to you?  \\n - Well, I don't have software sales experience,  \\n but I went on your website  \\n and I saw the impact you're making on customers  \\n and how much you've changed their business.  \\n It just seemed so exciting  \\n and I wanted to be a part of it.  \\n - Well, it is true  \\n I know you've been sort of on the side  \\n part of the business. - Right.  \\n So what kind of learning curve  \\n do you think you might have here?  \\n - Well, I know I'm going to need to get up to speed  \\n really quickly to be successful  \\n and I waitressed all through college  \\n and did my schoolwork on the nights and weekends  \\n so I'm confident I can study.  \\n I've already started planning  \\n and I can get up to speed quickly.  \\n - So what would be your plan then?  \\n Because you are going to have to ramp up  \\n - Right.  \\n Well, I can use nights and weekends  \\n to study your customers, study different solutions  \\n and study, really the details of the product.  \\n - Okay, that sounds good.  \\n Now as you compare both of those situations,  \\n which Elizabeth do you think would be the better hire?  \\n You know, it might seem deceiving  \\n based on the interview  \\n because in the first scenario,  \\n she was someone that had sales skills  \\n but in the second scenario,  \\n the way that she played it  \\n and the answers that she gave  \\n actually make her a better choice.  \\n So why is that?

 \\n Everybody's got their head down, their perusing information,  \\n that is not a good use of meeting time.  \\n Instead, what you're better off doing is sending out  \\n all the materials in advance and setting an expectation  \\n that everyone will have read them and be familiar  \\n with them and then call a meeting to talk  \\n about how you're going to use them  \\n and do actual role plays, do practice scenarios.  \\n So instead of everyone just looking at a screen  \\n or looking at some papers,  \\n they're interacting with each other.  \\n Let's look at another type scenario.  \\n You have a new employee on board,  \\n now what often happens is we send out an email,  \\n join me in welcoming Susan to our staff.  \\n She's going to be working over in XYZ department.  \\n We're super excited about having her.  \\n Well, that's okay but what's the likelihood  \\n everyone's going to walk over and meet her.  \\n Instead, if you've got the capacity,  \\n a new employee is actually a great reason  \\n to have a short meeting and there's a couple of reasons why,  \\n one, you want your new employee,  \\n whether they work for you or not,  \\n you want them to feel special.  \\n You want 'em to feel welcome right from the first day.  \\n And here's the other thing,  \\n particularly with someone in another department,  \\n you want your team to know who that person is.  \\n And if you set that person up for success, here's Susan,  \\n let me tell you about our background.  \\n I want you all to get to know her  \\n and your team has a face to face interaction with her,  \\n then what's going to happen is they're going to form  \\n a better connection than they would  \\n if you just send out an email.  \\n Now, here's another type of meeting that everyone's been to  \\n and I call it the shame meeting, common experience in sales,  \\n nobody submits their expense reports on time.  \\n So what does the boss do?

that often happens\\nto new managers is you may be annoyed by the amount\\nof administrative work that you've just come into.\\nBeing in the field can be exhilarating,\\nbeing chained to email, not so much.\\nIf you're a gregarious expert,\\nyou're going to have to create systems\\nfor handling admin work.\\nNow, the last reason great salespeople often don't translate\\ninto great sales managers,\\nand this is one of the hardest lessons to learn,\\nis there are a lot of differences in skills.\\n\\nYou were promoted because you're good,\\nmaybe you're even great,\\nand your expectations are probably very high.\\nThis is a good thing, but you need to recognize\\nnot everyone is going to have your same level of performance.\\nOne of the surprise that many new mangers discover,\\nand it's not a very pleasant surprise,\\nis there are a lot of variations in performance.\\nThings that you assumed were standard sometimes aren't,\\nbut don't get discouraged.\\nIf you're thinking right now, oh my gosh,\\nI'm in over my head, why am I even here?\\nRelax, odds are if you upscale yourself on just a few things\\nyou can be successful.\\n\\nNow, they might not come as naturally to you\\nas your last sales position, but you can do this.\\nThe fact that you recognize that you have some challenges\\nand that you're here in this course\\nproactively trying to improve,\\nwell that alone will put you ahead of a majority\\nof sales managers,\\nsome of whom may have even been in this position\\nlonger than you.\\nSo, let's talk about what you can do to combat\\nthe challenges that I've just mentioned.\\nSo, the first thing is to remember that the enthusiasm\\nthat won you customers may not have the same effect\\non your team.\\n\\nI want you to think about some of your best bosses,\\nthey're excited, yes,\\nthey're also even-tempered and level headed.\\nSo, your job as a leader is part pep rally,\\nbut it actually goes beyond that.\\nBecause see, your team is going to look to you\\nas a calming force,\\nas someone who knows how to handle challenges.\\nSo, focus on reading situations and recognize\\nan upbeat attitude can be good,\\nbut being too over the top, it can be exhausting,\\nespecially if you have some more introverted people\\non your team.\\n\\nNow, the second thing is, focus on the fact\\nthat this is a very different role,\\nthere's going to be administrative work.\\nWhen you started your sales career,\\nthere were probably some aspects of the job\\nthat you didn't absolutely love.\\nSo when it comes to admin work find someone, a peer,\\nsomeone who is good at getting these types of things done,\\nand ask them for tips.\\nBecause you see, you have the opportunity to create\\na killer sales team and you could add more value\\nto a larger group of customers,\\nso you want to get the admin part of your job done\\nas painlessly as possible.\\n\\nAnd the last thing,\\nwhen you look at the performance of your team,\\none of the things that you want to make sure you do\\nis schedule enough open time in your day to coach them.\\nAccording to Revegy, companies with reps who received\\nless than 30 minutes of coaching a week\\nhave a win rate of 43%,\\nbut companies where reps are coached more than two hours\\na week have a win rate of 56%.\\nSo, do the math on your team and figure out\\nthe way that would affect you, it's huge.\\n\\nSo, as a new sales manager, set high expectations,\\nmake them clear, but don't make the rookie mistake\\nof being easily frustrated.\\nCoach your team, be constructive and be patient.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:580009\",\"duration\":229,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Understanding your

The sales pipeline.\\nIt's life or death for a sales team.\\nSo you're familiar with the basic sales pipeline\\nfrom your time as a rep and you probably\\nhave your own terms for your sales process.\\nI want to focus on the three most common stages, though.\\nLeads, prospects, and customers.\\nPipeline management can be one of the most challenging\\naspects of leadership for new sales managers.\\nSo why is that?\\nWell because it's hard.\\nInstead of just managing your personal pipeline,\\nyou now have to look at a shared pipeline\\nwith a lot of different customers\\nat different stages in the process.\\n\\nAnd they weren't all evaluated by you.\\nThey were evaluated by your team\\nwho may or may not be accurate.\\nSo, what's your goal as a new manager?\\nWell obviously you want a closed business.\\nWhich part of the pipeline is most likely\\ngoing to result in closing new business right now?\\nWell that's your prospects.\\nAnd that's why they tend to get the most attention\\nbut this can be a challenge because in the rush\\nof day to day business and trying to close deals\\nwith prospects, the areas most likely to be ignored\\nby new sales managers are the leads.\\n\\nBut it's pretty obvious what happens\\nif you neglect lead generation and lead nurturing.\\nThe challenge is, this aspect of the pipeline\\noften falls under the important but not urgent\\nand thus it fails to get attention.\\nBut the effect of neglecting lead generation\\nand lead nurturing, it doesn't show up immediately.\\nIt takes a few months.\\nBut it will happen.\\nAnd then if you neglected it,\\nit will take you many more months in order to rebound.\\n\\nYou know it can also be easy to forget about\\nexisting customers but if you neglect your\\nexisting customers you lose the potential to upsell them\\nor even worse, you might lose them entirely\\nto a company who's paying attention to them,\\nto a company who's having regular conversations\\nabout their goals and what's happening in the industry.\\nSave yourself some future pain.\\nTalk about each area of the pipeline with your reps,\\nleads, prospects, and customers.\\nSo let's look at a couple of examples of\\nhow you as a manager can effectively discuss\\neach of these with a sales rep.\\n\\nElizabeth, do you have a minute?\\n- Yeah, sure.\\n- Yeah, I want to ask you a little bit about your pipeline.\\nIt's looking really good.\\n- Yeah I have an awesome deal on the table tomorrow.\\nI'm meeting with the CFO and he's totally bought in.\\n- Good, I'm excited.\\nHow do you feel about the value story?\\n- It's really strong.\\nI mean, he came to us through the website\\nand he was already on top of it.\\n- Okay, good.\\nIs there anything else that you need\\nthat you think would make it stronger?\\n- I don't think so, I mean he's a decision maker.\\nWe've talked a lot about his goals.\\nI think it's going to close.\\n- Okay, that sounds really good.\\nI see you've got a couple of others here\\non your 30 day horizon.\\n\\n- It's going to be a good month.\\n- That's great, I'm excited for you.\\nSo, let me ask about the things that are\\na little further away, 120, 180 days.\\nWhat have you got going on there?\\n- You mean like my other prospects?\\n- Well not so much your other prospects\\nbut one of the things I noticed is\\nyou've done a great job of working these deals\\nall the way through, but I'm curious\\nif you have any leads that you're nurturing.\\n- Oh, yes.\\nSo I just got some leads from marketing last week.\\nI've been kind of softly introducing myself.\\nSent some articles,\\nasked a few questions about their business.\\n- Okay.\\nI think that's really good.\\n\\nWhen I look at what you've got going on now,\\nyou spent a good bit of time nurturing those\\nto get them here, how much time are you spending\\nnurturing the current leads that you have?\\n- Probably about an hour a week.\\nI usually just do it Friday afternoon.\\n- Okay, does that feel appropriate to you?\\nDo you want to maybe consider upping that?\\n- I think I could add some more time earlier in the week.\\nI don't think it would hurt in the long run.\\n- Yeah, I think that's a really good idea\\nbecause I think you're doing a good job\\nadding value early and when I look at the\\nstrong month that you're probably going to have,\\nit's a result of what you did about six months ago.\\n\\n- Good point.\\n- Yeah, so I want you to keep applying that effort\\nso you don't want to end up with a big goose egg\\nat the end of the year.\\n- Right.\\n- So, last quick question.\\nI'm looking at your customers here.\\nHow much time are you spending reaching out to them?\\n- It kind of depends.\\nI mean, they usually call me when they have questions\\nand that's just the relationship we've always had,\\nbut they're good, they know the product.\\n- Yeah, I think that's true.\\nAnd you do have a really good relationship\\nwith your existing customers.\\nYou know, as I'm thinking about this,\\none of the things, I mean we were caught off guard\\nlast year because we lost a few customers.\\nNot yours, but others.\\n\\nAnd so I want to make sure that everybody's\\nreally shoring up the relationship\\nwith the existing customers.\\nIs there something you can do with them\\nto be more proactive and reach out?\\n- Yeah, we have a few new training tools\\nthat I think would help them on some newer features\\nand even just checking in with them,\\nmaking sure they don't have questions.\\n- Okay, I think that's a really good idea.\\nI think you're going to have a great month,\\nI just want to make sure that what you've got\\non either side of it is really well-balanced\\nso you have a really good year.\\n- Thanks, me too.\\n- Did you notice how each piece of the pipeline\\nhad a different set of questions that the manager\\nasked the rep?\\nYet they're all focused on that same through line,\\ncustomer impact.\\n\\nAs a new manager, you might discover that some of\\nyour reps have pie in the sky pipelines.\\nThey're never going to close\\neverything that they're forecasting.\\nIf you're having a panic moment right now,\\nthinking, oh my gosh, I'm not sure we have\\na good pipeline, or even worse, we don't have a pipeline,\\nbreathe.\\nHave you ever heard the expression\\nthe best time to plant a tree was ten years ago\\nbut the second best time is right now?\\nSo as a manager, just make an effort to ensure\\nthat you have enough leads in your team's pipeline\\nand remember not to neglect those leads\\nwhen they turn into prospects and customers.\\n\\nKnow what to measure.\\nTalk about every area of the pipeline with your reps\\nand communicate the big

is.\\nFirst off, a sales coach,\\nthey're not a sales assistant.\\nThe goal of sales coaching is to improve your reps' ability\\nto be successful by themselves without you there.\\nIf you're jumping in at every mistake\\nor taking the hard part of all the conversations,\\nthat's not the most effective way to coach.\\n\\nYour rep may pick up a few things from observing you,\\nbut the negative effect on their confidence\\nand their ability to manage calls without you\\nfar outweighs learning by observing you only.\\nSo, coaching your reps means helping them figure out\\nchallenging scenarios by themselves and providing\\nconstructive feedback rather than just a critique.\\nSo, when you're coaching,\\nyou want to focus on behaviors, not outcomes.\\nSales coaching adds a layer of complexity,\\nbecause each situation is really different\\nbecause each customer is different.\\n\\nBut good behaviors lead to the same results.\\nThink about it this way.\\nImagine you were coaching a child on how to hit a baseball.\\nYou wouldn't say, I want you to hit a home run\\nand then just let them go do it.\\nInstead, you would teach them how to hold the bat,\\nhow to keep their eye on the ball,\\nhow to follow through with their swing.\\nIf they keep these strategies, these behaviors in mind,\\nno matter how the pitcher throws the ball at them,\\nthey'll have a greater chance for success.\\nSo, if you want your rep to build more value,\\nteach them how to ask questions and be insightful.\\n\\nIf you want your rep to generate more leads,\\nteach them about networking and how to ask for referrals.\\nThese are the behaviors that will drive\\nthe outcome you're looking for, which is more sales.\\nSo, if you want to take a deep dive into sales coaching,\\ntake the sales coaching

and stay.\\nWhen you give the rep the bad rep and possible customers\\nit only makes them worse.\\n\\nThey don't know how to handle tough questions,\\nthey have poor negotiation skills,\\nand bringing all that to the surface erodes their confidence\\nand it erodes your reputation in the market.\\nSo, what do you do?\\nWell, show them what good looks like.\\nNow, this doesn't mean taking over all

just survived another meeting\\nthat should have been done in an email.\\nWe have all been in that meeting.\\nYou have a million things to do,\\nyour boss calls a meeting,\\nand you sit there while they attempt to figure out\\nthe agenda while everybody's already in the room.\\nIt's frustrating for the individual\\nand it also has a detrimental effect on the organization.\\nSo, let's look at a couple of meeting scenarios\\nand I'm going to share the opening with you,\\nand I want you to decide which of these\\nactually merits a meeting and which one\\nshould be done in an email.\\n\\nSo, the first scenario,\\nmaybe you have some new sales support materials.\\nNow, what commonly happens is\\nthe manager gets the new materials,\\nthey call the meeting,\\nthey say, guys we've got these new materials,\\nI'm going to pass them out or we're all\\ngoing to look at them on our screen.\\nAnd then what happens,\\neverybody's got their head down,\\nthey're perusing information.\\nThat is not a good use of meeting time.\\nInstead, what you're better off doing is\\nsending out all the materials in advance\\nand setting an expectation that everyone\\nwill have read them and be familiar with them,\\nand then call a meeting to talk about\\nhow you're going to use them and do actual role plays,\\ndo practice scenarios.\\n\\nSo, instead of everyone just looking at a screen\\nor looking at some papers,\\nthey're interacting with each other.\\nLet's look at another type scenario.\\nYou have a new employee on board.\\nNow, what often happens is we send out an email.\\nJoin me in welcoming Susan to our staff,\\nshe's going to be working over in XYZ department,\\nwe're super excited about having her.\\nWell, that's okay,\\nbut what's the likelihood everyone's going to\\nwalk over and meet her.\\nInstead, if you've got the capacity,\\na new employee is actually a great reason\\nto have a short meeting.\\n\\nAnd there's a couple of reasons why.\\nOne, you want your new employee,\\nwhether they work for you or not,\\nyou want them to feel special,\\nyou want them to feel welcome right from the first day.\\nAnd here's the other thing,\\nparticularly with someone in another department,\\nyou want your team to know who that person is.\\nAnd if you set that person up for success,\\nhere's Susan, let me tell you about her background,\\nI want you all to get to know her,\\nand your team has a face-to-face interaction with her,\\nthen what's going to happen is they're going to form\\na better connection than they would\\nif you just sent out an email.\\n\\nBecause then she becomes a real life person\\nand you're going to take the time to get to know her,\\nwhich will make you more productive in the long run.\\nNow, here's another type of meeting that everyone's been to,\\nand I call it the shame meeting.\\nCommon experience in sales,\\nnobody submits their expense reports on time.\\nSo, what does the boss do?\\nCalls together a meeting,\\ngoes around the room,\\nyou guys need to start submitting\\nyour expense reports on time,\\naccounting's after me so-and-so's after me,\\nyou guys have to do this.\\n\\nThe boss rakes everybody over the coals\\nfor the exact same problem.\\nWe all roll our eyes, sort of look down at our phones,\\nbut nothing changes because you know what,\\nnow we know we all have the same bad habits,\\nand so there's no accountability.\\nInstead, if you want to create accountability\\nand correct a problem,\\nyou need to do it in individual meetings.\\nIf you address this in a group,\\nno one's going to take responsibility because they know,\\nhey we've all been doing this\\nand nothing bad has happened yet.\\n\\nSo, what you want to do is get eyeball to eyeball\\nwith each one of your reps and just do it\\nin a one or two minute conversation.\\nSo, another type meeting,\\nwe just lost a big account.\\nNow, this one is really painful and it's really tricky.\\nIn this one the email's probably\\nalready gone out and everybody knows.\\nOnce that happens then you do need to have a meeting,\\nbut the first meeting needs to be private\\nwith the rep or the reps that caused you to lose the account\\nbecause this meeting is going to be really, really painful.\\n\\nYou want the people who lost the business\\nto understand why and unpack it.\\nBut then here's where you go with this,\\nif there's some lessons to be learned,\\nthe next meeting should be\\na group meeting with the whole team.\\n'Cause, again, everybody knows\\nwe already lost the big account,\\nso instead of you presenting it in a public shaming,\\nthe people who lost the business need to share\\nwhat they've learned,\\nhow they're going to either salvage it\\nor do things differently next time.\\nBecause you want them to feel confident and empowered.\\n\\nYou want the team to see, hey this happened,\\nbut we can recover.\\nSo, they need to be in the place\\nwhere they're leading the whole team to better performance.\\nSo, are you starting to notice a pattern\\non these different types of meetings?\\nIf you think something can be done via email,\\nchances are it can be.\\nEmails are best for facts.\\nMeetings are the place where you need\\nto foster positive emotions,\\nwhere you work through problems,\\nwhere you generate ideas,\\nwhere you talk about plans.\\n\\nBecause, you see, time is the most valuable resource\\nfor you and your sales team.\\nTime is the one thing you can't make more of.\\nSo, before you call a meeting,\\nthink twice before you gather a bunch of people in a room\\nand tell them something trivial.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:580019\",\"duration\":217,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Types of

type,\\nis a creative brainstorming meeting,\\nand that's pretty straightforward.\\nThis is when you're talking about new sales strategy,\\nor potential customers,\\nor implementation or networking techniques.\\nNow, these meetings are run by you,\\nbut you don't provide all the content.\\nYour job as the manager is to facilitate discussion.\\n\\nThen, at the end of the meeting,\\nyou want to make sure that you nailed down\\nthe concrete action steps and hold the group accountable.\\nAnother type of meeting is the information sharing meeting.\\nMaybe there's a new product,\\nmaybe there's a change in leadership.\\nThe purpose of this meeting is not\\nto simply share the facts,\\nbut to generate enthusiasm for whatever it is\\nyou're talking about, to answer questions,\\nto anticipate any challenges.\\nSo, the facts and information can become actionable.\\n\\nIf you want to hold this type of meeting,\\nmake sure that you actually have something\\nimportant to share,\\nand that you're crystal clear on what your reps\\nneed to know and what you want them to do.\\nNow, the third type of meeting is a meeting\\nwhere you might communicate expectations,\\ngroup expectations.\\nMaybe you're pipeline is too light,\\nmaybe a lot of emails are coming in,\\nyou're not responding to leads.\\nThat's this type of meeting.\\nIt doesn't have to be negative,\\nit could also be positive.\\nIt's communicating expectations and it should be consistent,\\nbut it's not just reserved for performance reviews\\nor new hires.\\n\\nThe purpose for communicating expectations\\nin a group meeting is to create a shared,\\nteam-wide understanding.\\nYou should also follow up with people one-on-one.\\nNow, the fourth type of meeting is something\\nthat a lot of people ignore.\\nI call it the Weekly Huddle.\\nIf you're not doing these, I highly recommend it.\\nA weekly huddle will improve the speed\\nand accountability of your team.\\nNow, the huddle can be done virtually,\\nor it can be done in person.\\nAnd if you're doing them in person,\\nI really recommend that you do your huddles standing.\\n\\nYou want a high energy environment.\\nSo, this meeting covers what happened last week\\nand what needs to be accomplished this week.\\nIt's short, it's got lots of energy.\\nWho sold what?\\nWhat's getting closed next week?\\nWhat do we want to do?\\nAnd then, the next week you come back and say,\\ndid we do it or did we not?\\nAnd where are we going next week?\\nNo minutia, just high energy highlights.\\n'Cause here's the thing about a weekly huddle,\\nthere's nowhere for procrastinators and do-nothings to hide.\\n\\nA weekly huddle ensures that you're moving quickly\\nand accurately towards your goals.\\nSo, regardless of which type of meeting you're having,\\nmake sure it has defined agenda and outcome\\nbefore everyone is in the room.\\nNothing is more frustrating than rearranging your schedule\\nto sit in a room with a lot of other people\\nwho did the same thing, yet nobody knows why they're there.\\nSo, before you call a meeting,\\nthink about, what are your goals,\\nwhat are the objectives?\\nBy the end of this meeting,\\nwhat would success look like for you?\\nBe really clear.\\n\\nIs it that your reps will have a new understanding\\nof some issue,\\nor maybe they'll be proficient in a new product

There are two big mistakes that people make with meetings.\\nThe first mistake is assuming that meetings\\nare the opportunity to simply transmit information.\\nIn actuality, meetings are an opportunity\\nto share information.\\nThe difference is subtle, but it's really important.\\nTransmitting is a one-way method of communication,\\nand frankly, that's why so many meetings are so boring.\\nYou know, the second mistake people make is\\nthere are no action items for the meeting.\\n\\nInstead, conversations just circle\\naround and around the same issues,\\neverybody looks down on their phone,\\nand nothing actually happens.\\nSo how do you avoid this?\\nThe key is to let people know right from the beginning\\nthat your meeting is not going to fall\\ninto either of these traps.\\nNow you can do this by having a tight agenda\\nand indicating on the agenda itself for each item\\nwhat do you expect the group to discuss,\\nwhat input do you need from the group,\\nand what decisions need to be made\\nby the end of the meeting.\\n\\nSo let's look at an example.\\nImagine your team is behind on hitting their number.\\nNow, it would be easy to just show the number and say,\\n\\\"Hey guys, we're behind.\\n\\\"You need to sell more.\\\"\\nWell, it's easy, but it doesn't work.\\nIf it worked that way, everyone can be a sales manager.\\nInstead, you need to put on the agenda quota shortage,\\nand then underneath that you put reasons, question mark.\\nBelow that, strategies for overcoming, question mark.\\n\\nBelow that, key action items.\\nThen when you open the meeting,\\nyou can say something like this,\\n\\\"We all know we're behind on hitting our number.\\n\\\"So what I'd like us to do today as a group is unpack.\\n\\\"Why are we here?\\n\\\"What's happened or what's not happened?\\n\\\"Then I'd like us to discuss some strategies\\n\\\"for getting back on track.\\n\\\"And I want us to leave here\\n\\\"with between one and three action items\\n\\\"that we can implement immediately\\n\\\"and that we all agree to.\\\"\\nSo that tells your team right from the beginning\\nthis is going to be an interactive meeting.\\n\\nWe're going to be discussing this and making decisions,\\nand we will all be held accountable for action items.\\nNow, I did this in a negative situation,\\nbut the same format works in a positive situation.\\nIf it was something new and exciting,\\nI would greet the group with a smile and say,\\n\\\"Hey this is going to be a great meeting.\\n\\\"We're going to talk about this great new thing.\\n\\\"We're going to brainstorm a bunch of ideas,\\n\\\"and then we're going to come up with some fun possibilities,\\n\\\"and we're all going to take action.\\\"\\nSo the important thing is you need to let people know\\nwhy they're there and they need to know\\nthis is not going to be death by PowerPoint.\\n\\nSo your tone at the very beginning of the meeting\\nand the agenda that you show people,\\nthe expectations you lay out,\\nthey tell them this is an all-in meeting.\\nThis isn't about you, the sales manager,\\nwah, wah, wah, wah, wah.\\nIt's about them and where you all are going as a

customers\\nthat can be a huge asset for you in meetings.\\nThe first is someone from product development.\\nNow, smart sales managers stay informed\\nabout what's happening in product development,\\nand they keep the product development team\\ninformed about the feedback they're getting from the field.\\n\\nSo, you don't have to invite\\nthe head of product development,\\nif you can get her, great, but if you can't,\\njust establish a regular peer to peer relationship\\nwith someone on that team.\\nIt will benefit you, it will benefit them,\\nand it will benefit your people immensely.\\nNow, another type of person you should think about\\nbringing into your sales meetings is someone from marketing.\\nThe job of sales is to close business,\\nbut the job of marketing is to create\\nthat opportunity for you.\\nSo, when you invite someone from marketing in,\\nthere's one mistake though that people often make,\\ndo not do this,\\ndo not let the first words out of your mouth be,\\nwe're not getting enough leads.\\n\\nMarketing has heard it,\\nso don't let your team complain about that either,\\nespecially not at the first part of the meeting.\\nInstead, ask the marketing person,\\nwhat are you excited about?\\nWhat are the key messages that are resonating out\\nwith perspective customers?\\nWhat can we do out in the field to support the brand?\\nSales managers who develop a good relationship\\nwith marketing, they get more support\\nand they have more influence.\\n\\nAnd so, while you may want to get more leads,\\ncomplaining about it is no the way to get them.\\nDevelop the relationship first.\\nNow, the third person that you want to consider\\nbringing into your meetings is your boss.\\nNow, you don't want to do this in the beginning,\\nyou

the chance for you to elevate your team.\\nOne mistake that new sales managers often make\\nis they think, oh the boss is sitting here,\\nI better look good in front of the boss,\\nwell not exactly.\\nIf you want to look good in front of the boss,\\nthe best thing you can do is showcase the performance\\nof your team.\\nSo, make sure you have some good and true examples\\nof the wins

spreads\\nto the rest of your body,\\nyour face gets flushed, it's horrible.\\n\\nThe only thing that makes failure worse is when it's public.\\nUnfortunately, as a sales manager,\\nit's very probable that your failures will be public.\\nSo, how do you deal with it?\\nThe first step is to acknowledge that failure\\nis part of success.\\nAnyone who has ever achieved anything big has failed,\\nand they failed a lot.\\nI've had businesses fail, I've lost deals,\\nI've been passed over for promotions,\\nand so has everyone else.\\n\\nBut you know, it wasn't until a small incident\\njust a few

success,\\nand so were all the other big and small failures\\nbefore and after that.\\nNow, the second key component for rebounding from failure\\nis to acknowledge it.\\n\\nGetting defensive and acting like it didn't happen\\nmay seem less painful,\\nbut it actually just prolongs the agony.\\nSo, let's take a lesson in this from martial arts.\\nIn martial arts, you don't fight against negative energy,\\nyou redirect it.\\nSo, imagine you fail, say you lost a big deal\\nor your best rep quit and went to the competition,\\nyour boss is really angry.\\nYou have two choices, you can get defensive\\nand you can spend a lot of time explaining\\nwhy it wasn't your fault,\\nwe couldn't meet the price,\\nsomeone stole them from behind my back, whatever it is,\\nbut every minute when you're defensive is another minute\\nthat you are stuck inside the problem\\ninstead of moving towards the solution.\\n\\nYears ago, a colleague of mine made a huge mistake\\non a marketing program.\\nIt was an honest mistake, but it was also really expensive,\\nand when his boss discovered it,\\nshe went just charging into his office,\\nand so he kept trying to explain,\\nthis is why it happened, this is why it wasn't my fault,\\nand then she kept ranting about how horrible it was,\\nbut then he remembered the martial arts technique\\nand he said, hmm, you're right, it was horrible,\\nnow let's talk about what to do.\\n\\nThe situation changed in that instant,\\nbecause instead of being on opposing teams,\\nhe redirected the energy and they were on the same team.\\nIf you want to redirect the energy,\\nit requires that you acknowledge the failure\\nand your part in it in no uncertain terms.\\nAnd that means, you've got to let go of your ego.\\nThe next secret is, once you acknowledge it,\\ndon't prolong the agony.\\nYou don't need to fall on your sword repeatedly.\\nIf you failed and it involves your team,\\ntake responsibility publicly.\\n\\nSimply say, I thought this was a good idea,\\nI was wrong, it failed.\\nLet's move on and figure out what we can learn.\\nYou might also want to tell your team,\\nif you see me making mistakes like this\\nin the future, speak up.\\nI'd rather you all tell me I'm down the wrong path sooner\\nrather than later.\\nFailure is never fatal.\\nEvery CEO on this planet has had huge failures.\\nGreat parents fail, sports stars fail,\\nwe all fail.\\n\\nI have, and so will you.\\nBut failure doesn't have to define you.\\nWhat defines you is your ability to rebound from failure.\\nSo, own it, learn from it,\\nand

 \\n Or, do you want to make a difference?  \\n I've got some great news for you.  \\n You don't have to choose.  \\n Sales is a noble profession.  \\n You don't believe me?  \\n Well, think about all the exceptional salespeople  \\n that you know.  \\n And if you're a sales leader, you're probably one of them.  \\n The research tells us that great salespeople  \\n are more driven to solve problems for their customers.  \\n They're great relationship builders  \\n and they're exceptional listeners.  \\n They're level-headed, they're laser-like focused  \\n on adding value and improving life for customers.  \\n They have a noble purpose.  \\n And because of that, these more purpose-driven salespeople  \\n wind up making more money  \\n than their more transactional, quota-obsessed peers.  \\n It's a phenomenon that you've probably seen  \\n play out anecdotally.  \\n The reps who are pushing too hard to close,  \\n they're less likely to close.  \\n But focusing less on the money,  \\n winds up making you more money.  \\n The research completely backs this up.  \\n Research from a former Proctor & Gamble colleague of mine,  \\n Jim Stengel, revealed  \\n that organizations that have a noble purpose,  \\n who put improving life for customers  \\n at the center of their organization,  \\n they outperformed their transactional counterparts  \\n by over 350%.  \\n Now, here's where it gets even more interesting.  \\n This plays out at an individual level, in a big way.  \\n New research from Dr. Valerie Goode  \\n at Michigan State University,  \\n it demonstrated that salespeople  \\n who want to make a difference for their customers  \\n are more adaptable and resilient  \\n than salespeople who are focused  \\n on their own financial incentives.  \\n You've probably experienced this personally yourself.  \\n Because you see, as humans,  \\n we're at our best when we are in the service of others.  \\n So as a sales leader,  \\n you absolutely need to pay your sales team well.  \\n Competitive comp is the table stakes  \\n for motivating a sales team.  \\n But what the research tells us and what we already know  \\n in our own hearts to be true, is that money isn't enough.  \\n Not in the long term.  \\n Your sales team needs a purpose beyond making quota.  \\n A noble purpose that fills them with pride  \\n and that sustains them  \\n when things inevitably get challenging.  \\n Perhaps your organization already has a purpose  \\n that you can leverage.  \\n If not or if your organizational purpose  \\n leaves a little bit to be desired,  \\n I encourage you to create a statement for your sales team.  \\n Now this purpose statement tells everyone,  \\n your team and your customers, why you exist.  \\n It's an inspiring rallying cry  \\n that captures who you are on your very best day.  \\n And you can create this by looking for inspiration  \\n in a couple of places.  \\n Customer testimonials.  \\n What do your best customers say about you?  \\n How would they describe the difference that you make  \\n in their lives and their businesses?  \\n Also, look within your team.  \\n If you have long-term employees or excited new talent,  \\n ask them what made them want to join your organization  \\n or stay with your organization.  \\n You will typically get an answer  \\n beyond just a good comp plan.  \\n Now, don't put too much pressure on yourself  \\n to craft the perfect words.  \\n What's important here, is that you are clear and specific.  \\n Go ahead and try it right now.  \\n Just pause this video and set the timer for five minutes.  \\n Using the notebook right below this course player  \\n or your own pen and paper.  \\n I want you to start jotting  \\n down some ideas that will get the ball rolling.  \\n And again, what's important,  \\n is that you are clear and specific.  \\n (upbeat music)  \\n Okay.  \\n you can refine it from here, if you need to.  \\n I'm going to give you an example.  \\n One of our clients is an IT service firm  \\n and their purpose statement is  \\n \\\"We make small businesses more successful.\\\"  \\n Another company in the transportation space rallies around  \\n \\\"We make transportation safer, faster and more reliable.\\\"  \\n It's simple and it works.  \\n Because it tells the sales team, this is why we exist.  \\n Their noble purpose gives them a north star,  \\n that guides them through the sales process.  \\n It tells them exactly  \\n what they should be doing for customers  \\n and shows them what making an impact looks like,  \\n beyond just closing a simple deal.  \\n You see, that's the power of purpose,  \\n getting clear about your impact,  \\n it helps you rally your team around making a difference,  \\n which is the secret for driving motivation and revenue.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4402102\",\"duration\":246,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Set the psychological center\",\"fileName\":\"3097286_en_US_01_02_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Sales is a fast-moving business and without a steady psychological center, your team can frantically lurch from deal to deal.

Jane closed a six figure deal.  \\n Woo-hoo, Jane!  \\n Everyone, be like Jane.  \\n Now that's not bad.  \\n Good work definitely deserves a shout out.  \\n But what is the rest of the team thinking?  \\n Maybe they're happy for Jane  \\n or maybe they're super competitive like me  \\n and they're more than a little bit jealous.  \\n Next year, it's going to be me.  \\n But probably most of them are some of both.  \\n Either way, when they only hear yay! Jane,  \\n they're not prepared to replicate what she did.  \\n Jane might not even be prepared to replicate it.  \\n So now let's look at a better way for you,  \\n the sales leader, to celebrate a win.  \\n Jane closed a great deal with a new client,  \\n Johnson Manufacturing,  \\n and Jane worked really hard for this one.  \\n She had multiple discovery conversations,  \\n she asked really deep questions,  \\n and she peeled back the layers  \\n to uncover their most urgent issues.  \\n Then Jane connected the customer's competitive threats  \\n with their need to better leverage  \\n their existing customer data.  \\n And that's when Jane's buyer became really engaged.  \\n And our solution is going to help this customer  \\n better leverage their data, which will give them insights  \\n into their marketing and their customers.  \\n Because of Jane, Johnson Manufacturing is prepared  \\n to be more successful in the future.  \\n Now that second one was a little bit longer,  \\n instead of two short sentences,  \\n it's four more lengthy sentences,  \\n but it's so much more effective,  \\n because it got specific about a couple of important factors.  \\n First, Jane closed the business,  \\n and as a sales leader,  \\n celebrating the success of your team is so important.  \\n But next, we also know why the business closed,  \\n the behaviors that got it there,  \\n deep discovery, building the value case,  \\n and being flexible in the face of changing conditions.  \\n This tells the team, here's how you can be successful.  \\n Lastly, the customer was positively impacted  \\n in this specific way.  \\n When customers win, we win.  \\n The team knows our work matters.  \\n So now, even if the team is still a little bit jealous  \\n of Jane, they know what a win looks like  \\n from a behavioral standpoint.  \\n It's not just because Jane is lucky  \\n or has some magical secret that they don't have.  \\n You as a sales leader have defined  \\n what makes a win, discovery and building value,  \\n and why a win matters.  \\n It's a win for Jane and a win for her customer  \\n and it's a replicatable process  \\n for everyone else on the team.  \\n So you want your team to go beyond simply closing business.  \\n You want to build sustainable,  \\n energetic growth that leaves everyone,  \\n your team and your customers, feeling great.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4402105\",\"duration\":234,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Establish a learning mindset with your sales team\",\"fileName\":\"3097286_en_US_01_05_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"When you stop learning, you stop earning; sales is a rapidly changing business.

I've just got to get some sleep.\\\"  \\n Those must be her two favorite things  \\n because she talks about them all the time.  \\n The words of the leader matter.  \\n Now, I'm fully confident if I had asked all those mothers  \\n what their favorite things are,  \\n cleaning would not be at the top of the list.  \\n Sleeping maybe, but definitely not cleaning.  \\n But because that's what they gave their airtime to,  \\n that's what their team assumed  \\n was the most important thing to them.  \\n So what's the sales leader equivalent  \\n of cleaning and sleeping?  \\n Well, you already know.  \\n It's the pipeline this week, this month, this quarter,  \\n however you measure it,  \\n the deals on the table, the activity targets,  \\n the outbound calls made or the appointment set.  \\n You see, sales leaders often fall into the trap  \\n of a numbers only narrative.  \\n And the numbers matter,  \\n just like cleaning and sleeping matter,  \\n but when you spend the majority of your leadership airtime  \\n on the numbers, your team thinks that's the only thing  \\n you care about.  \\n And they start to feel like cogs in a big machine.  \\n And they lose sight of the real big picture,  \\n which is you're making a difference to customers.  \\n So you want to use your leadership airtime  \\n to build deep belief with your team.  \\n One that will inspire them, that will motivate them,  \\n that will uplift them  \\n through the inevitable ebbs and flows of sales.  \\n So you can do this in several ways.  \\n You can tell what I call customer impact stories.  \\n Now, these are true stories  \\n about how your organization makes a difference to customers,  \\n and we're going to talk about this  \\n in more depth a little later in the course.  \\n Another thing you can do is you can share  \\n wins from the team,  \\n or you can talk about what's going on in your industry  \\n or with your customer base.  \\n How is your business landscape changing and evolving?  \\n You can also uplevel your team  \\n by sharing things like great discovery questions  \\n or new positioning strategies.  \\n How you spend your precious leadership airtime  \\n tells your team what's most important  \\n so use that airtime very wisely.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4402107\",\"duration\":213,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Share customer impact stories to ignite frontal lobes\",\"fileName\":\"3097286_en_US_02_02_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Case studies show off your product, win stories spotlight team success, but customer-impact stories are what inspire and motivate action.

 \\n - I mean, tens of thousands of dollars  \\n would enable them to hire more warehouse staff,  \\n which I know they're stretched really thin on,  \\n and they have some stiff competition with their customers,  \\n so anything they can do to be competitive  \\n on offering lower cost shipping,  \\n again because they saved on distribution cost,  \\n I think would really help their business.  \\n - This is such a great opportunity  \\n for you to make a difference to this customer.  \\n You have a real chance to impact their business  \\n in a major way, and I'm sure that they're going to see that.  \\n So take a breath, you got this.  \\n She's still a little nervous,  \\n but now she's grounded in what matters to the customer.  \\n So no matter what twists and turns arrives,  \\n she has a true north, customer impact.  \\n We talked about pipeline reviews.  \\n I told you that if a rep didn't have  \\n a good answer to this question,  \\n they likely didn't have the customer intelligence  \\n they needed to close the business.  \\n This moment is a little bit different,  \\n because time is of the essence.  \\n You only have a few minutes.  \\n So when Elizabeth stumbled a little bit in her answer,  \\n I was calm.  \\n I validated what she said  \\n and I just expanded on it a little bit.  \\n I want to make sure to end the conversation positively  \\n and pointed in the direction of the customer.  \\n Your rep has thought about the commission on the table  \\n and ringing the sales bell or making the President's Club.  \\n But as humans, we are at our best  \\n when we are in the service of others  \\n and nowhere is that more evident than in sales.  \\n So use those last few minutes  \\n to focus them on what we know will help them seal the deal,  \\n which is making a difference to customers.  \\n Now, what do you do when they're only a few seconds  \\n before a call?  \\n We're going to go over that next.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4402113\",\"duration\":187,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Micro-motivation: Upping enthusiasm in 10 seconds\",\"fileName\":\"3097286_en_US_03_03_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"If you have a big team, or you're stretched thin on time, you don't have time for big motivational speeches and the truth is, you don't need them.

Now do you wish you did anything differently?  \\n I mean, obviously it closed, so you did a lot right.  \\n But did anything trip you up during this process?  \\n - I mean, there was a big change in executive leadership  \\n and I definitely wish I saw that coming.  \\n So maybe I could have asked a couple more questions  \\n that gave me a clue into that.  \\n But obviously even though we got thrown  \\n for a little bit of a loop, we overcame it.  \\n - Yeah, you got through it.  \\n So tell me,  \\n what are you the most excited about for the customer?  \\n - They spend so much time on data management  \\n and our solution is going to cut that time in half  \\n which is going to be a huge, huge gift to them.  \\n - Yeah, yeah.  \\n This is the first of a streak for you.  \\n I can just feel it.  \\n 'Cause when your customers win, so do you.  \\n So now you go enjoy your evening.  \\n Having these win conversations  \\n with your rep should be a feel good moment for them  \\n and a feel good moment for you as the sales leader.  \\n It should also set them up for success  \\n ensuring that this win is only the beginning.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

 \\n You have to look at both sides of the question.  \\n Monitor what your reps are doing  \\n by looking at their call reports.  \\n They should be logging the time they spend  \\n with an internal support person,  \\n including what was discussed.  \\n Also, ask your support teams to generate status reports  \\n or to keep a log of their activity  \\n supporting your sales reps.  \\n Be attuned for any complaints you get from people  \\n in the corporate office as well as from your reps.  \\n Don't ignore these.  \\n The problems will only get worse.  \\n Your challenge is to make sure your reps  \\n find the right balance between selling time in the field  \\n versus time spent getting help  \\n from their internal colleagues.  \\n So here's a few tips to keep the operation running smoothly.  \\n First, set clear expectations with your sales reps  \\n and internal support people.  \\n Bring them together in joint meetings  \\n to talk about their interactions  \\n and what each side needs to do to be a good partner.  \\n Have conversations with the department heads  \\n to make sure you're in alignment with their priorities.  \\n Hey, these departments have other important jobs to do,  \\n so you need to make sure you stay on their radar screen.  \\n Next, invite support teams to be part  \\n of your sales training programs.  \\n Perhaps they can deliver training  \\n related to the support they provide.  \\n Finally, include support people in your reward  \\n and recognition programs.  \\n Invite them to the annual sales meeting  \\n and recognize the sales support person of the year.  \\n This not only creates a team environment,  \\n but it also motivates these very important people  \\n who are making you and your reps more successful.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4467773\",\"duration\":204,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Examine your team's sales funnel\",\"fileName\":\"460443_en_US_02_05_2023Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Most team managers with effective sales teams utilize a sales pipeline, often called a sales funnel.

What was proposed to the client?  \\n What issues or concerns were raised?  \\n What emails were exchanged?  \\n Now be sure to interview the rep involved  \\n as well as any support people that had a part in the deal.  \\n Develop a timeline of events from start to finish.  \\n Next, prepare for the interview with the client.  \\n Develop a set of questions  \\n based on what you learned in step one.  \\n So here are some questions you might want to ask.  \\n For wins ask: Why did we win?  \\n What set us apart from the competition?  \\n Where is the competition stronger than we are?  \\n Now for losses, you want to ask: What was it about  \\n the competitor that made you select them?  \\n How well did our solution align to your needs?  \\n What was the problem that you were trying to solve?  \\n How effective were our salespeople?  \\n Were there any breakdowns in our selling process?  \\n And most importantly, what can we do differently next time?  \\n Now, be careful here.  \\n Only ask questions that will yield information  \\n that you would act on.  \\n Don't make this an exhaustive focus group type interview  \\n where you chew up clients' valuable time,  \\n otherwise they'll resent it.  \\n Now it's time to conduct the interview,  \\n and that can be in person, via phone,  \\n or by using a video conferencing service.  \\n Whatever you do, keep it short and sweet.  \\n Whether you won the deal or lost it  \\n you want to leave a good impression  \\n with a client so they're willing to consider you next time.  \\n Finally, analyze the information  \\n and share it with your colleagues,  \\n especially other sales managers  \\n and your marketing counterparts.  \\n What actually happened versus what you expected to happen?  \\n Why the difference?  \\n What are you going to do about it next time?  \\n Losing a deal is not a failure.  \\n It's an opportunity to learn, so you win the next time.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4469763\",\"duration\":175,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Evaluate sales deployment\",\"fileName\":\"460443_en_US_03_03_2023Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, Drew Boyd teaches about the strategies a sales manager can use when a strong sales team must work in less-than-optimal circumstances.

As a sales manager, I've often said that when  \\n you break things down to the basic facts, we're only as good  \\n as the products or services our companies give us to sell.  \\n Then equally important is our team of sales representatives  \\n and account managers that report to us.  \\n Candidly, our reputation and success rides  \\n on those two key elements.  \\n However, although we do have input  \\n into the development of products and services  \\n we're a hundred percent responsible  \\n for the salespeople that report to us.  \\n A sales team that's not communicating well,  \\n getting weak feedback from customers  \\n and missing revenue targets means we are not  \\n doing a good job as managers either.  \\n When we first hear the topic of performance measurement  \\n and reporting, we normally immediately think  \\n of leads developed, close rates, objectives completed  \\n and most importantly, revenue targets reached and surpassed.  \\n Those are the critical pieces.  \\n However, since we do have that a hundred percent  \\n responsibility of the sales team  \\n it places even more critical importance  \\n on the coaching and training we provide.  \\n That needs to start the day you hire someone.  \\n Each of our companies should have a plan in place  \\n for the training of new staff, for the sales department  \\n if it's not done by you, it may be handled  \\n by the corporate trainer or an outside consultant  \\n hired to manage that task.  \\n However, we still need to play the key lead role  \\n in the direction of all training programs.  \\n We are responsible for the sales team and their results  \\n so then we must own the training and and development  \\n of each individual.  \\n My view is that sales training must include these  \\n six key components.  \\n First, we have sales process.  \\n This is whatever sales methodology you feel works best  \\n for your industry and product or service.  \\n I believe that mastering the basics of the  \\n seven to 10 step plan is ideal.  \\n However you may want to use some more advanced methodologies  \\n and then product or service knowledge, pretty  \\n straightforward, but our teams have to be more  \\n than just comfortable presenting our company's products  \\n or services.  \\n Also, collaborative selling.  \\n In this competitive marketplace, the best organizations  \\n know how to have other departments brought  \\n into the sales process to help close business.  \\n The days of the sales department not endorsing the team  \\n approach needs to be an issue of the past.  \\n Next, communication.  \\n Customer relationship management software  \\n has become such an important tool for making sales teams  \\n better organized and efficient,  \\n is it also helped improve the interaction  \\n with other departments  \\n and made our lives better with improved forecasting.  \\n Also consider expenses and financial.  \\n As salespeople, we've always been measured  \\n by our expense control management.  \\n However, I also feel training and profit  \\n and loss analysis makes our teams more well-rounded  \\n and professional.  \\n And individual coaching.  \\n This is a part of our job descriptions as managers.  \\n Each salesperson is different  \\n with their own strengths and weaknesses.  \\n The better we can regularly guide them to  \\n improve their skills, the stronger our entire team will be.  \\n A development plan  \\n for each is a wise investment, tough decisions.  \\n This is not a part of the six components  \\n but needs to be added  \\n to our coaching and training evaluations.  \\n As managers, we need to make tough decisions  \\n and changes sooner when we don't  \\n see sales representatives improving.  \\n The foundation we build  \\n with our sales organization to create a strong  \\n and ongoing training  \\n and coaching regimen is a critical piece  \\n of our management responsibility.  \\n If done well, it enables them to be stronger  \\n and better sales professionals.  \\n Their performance measurement and evaluation along  \\n with ours will be closely linked to the effectiveness  \\n of our commitment to this important obligation.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2647138\",\"duration\":196,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Drafting objectives for your sales direct report\",\"fileName\":\"587596_en_US_01_02_2023Q1_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Working with each salesperson to develop agreed-upon personal objectives can be an effective way to have them focus on skills and activities that will make them better sales professionals.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":8557096,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - What's your view about the use  \\n of personal objectives as a performance measure?  \\n I think if we were to ask 10 managers what their philosophy  \\n is about them, I predict we would get 10 different opinions.  \\n For me, developing personal objectives  \\n with a salesperson is a chance to combine the coaching  \\n that I really enjoy with the corporate mandate,  \\n which means I like the one-on-one session,  \\n since it's a focus on creating plans together  \\n to help the salesperson improve.  \\n I cringe at times that the corporate requirements  \\n because it can get too structured and formal.  \\n I'm of the school that less is more.  \\n I'd rather have five really actionable objectives  \\n than a laundry list that goes on for more than a dozen.  \\n I like that it's an assignment  \\n that I can work on together with each salesperson.  \\n It should be seen as a positive task rather than a burden.  \\n Many companies and managers  \\n like the use of the SMART performance management strategy  \\n since it clearly gives a strong direction  \\n to create effective objectives.  \\n S, Specific.  \\n This ties back to my preference for a focused objective  \\n and avoiding ones that have no clear direction.  \\n For a salesperson, we could say  \\n that during the first two quarters of the year,  \\n increase the amount of opportunities open by 20  \\n and dollar projections by a hundred thousand.  \\n M, Measurable.  \\n Using my prior example, I've stated real numbers,  \\n not a percentage, and have specific timetable of six months.  \\n There's no guesswork.  \\n Everyone is clear on the numbers.  \\n A, Achievable/Agreed.  \\n No one likes to be assigned a personal objective  \\n that's unrealistic, or one where they've had no input.  \\n As a manager, this is a great way to work  \\n on some mutual goals together and enable the salesperson  \\n to take some real ownership.  \\n R, Relevant/Realistic.  \\n It should be pretty straightforward  \\n but developing objectives that have no chance  \\n of being completed is demoralizing right from the start  \\n and really defeats the purpose altogether.  \\n Objectives need to stretch people,  \\n but also need to be achievable.  \\n That's the reward when they're accomplished.  \\n T, Trackable/Time Limit.  \\n I'm a big believer of timelines and dates.  \\n If you say something is due by the start of the month,  \\n it carries less significance  \\n than saying completion date required by May 1.  \\n I apply trackable timelines even for myself  \\n as it puts some pressure on it and importance.  \\n Working with each salesperson to develop and agreed upon set  \\n of personal objectives can be a really effective way  \\n to get everyone focused on performance improvement.  \\n The measurable items can be a win-win for everyone.  \\n It can build teamwork between you and your direct reports  \\n but even more importantly, enable you to coach  \\n and target improvements to enhance the skills  \\n for each sales professional.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2647139\",\"duration\":218,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using your performance appraisal process to grow skills\",\"fileName\":\"587596_en_US_01_03_2023Q1_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Do you mostly groan when you hear the words \\\"performance appraisal?\\\" When approached as a part of the overall manager and salesperson coaching process, appraisals can actually be done painlessly and can have productive results.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":11557397,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - A mention of performance appraisals  \\n probably brings a groan  \\n to most people since it often reminds many  \\n of us of the bureaucratic task of writing details  \\n about our work or the work of people who report to us.  \\n However, in a course about sales performance  \\n measurement and reporting, it's important  \\n that it is discussed since the appraisal remains one  \\n of the key evaluation pieces in most companies.  \\n There's been much debate and analysis  \\n about the use and value of performance appraisals.  \\n There are even some companies who've eliminated  \\n them completely.  \\n This is one of those situations where you need to work  \\n within the requirements of your company while  \\n at the same time look for ways to improve the process.  \\n Candidly, I dread the job  \\n of writing on all of those corporate forms  \\n noting each person's strengths and weaknesses.  \\n However, I really enjoy the one-on-one time working  \\n with a colleague to pinpoint opportunities  \\n for growth and to congratulate them when milestones set  \\n for improvement are reached.  \\n Here are some of my thoughts and recommendations  \\n that have made performance appraisals less burdensome  \\n for me and I think more of a positive experience for those  \\n I've worked with.  \\n 12 month plan.  \\n I once had a manager who reviewed my responsibilities  \\n and objectives at the start of the year.  \\n We never spoke about them again until two weeks  \\n before a year end when he would ask me to write  \\n up some updates for my performance appraisal.  \\n This is the classic example  \\n of why this type of evaluation doesn't work.  \\n It needs to be done much more regularly  \\n in smaller doses with an actual plan in mind.  \\n A quarterly discussion is certainly reasonable  \\n but I think it can be integrated  \\n in with an overall management plan with your staff.  \\n It makes appraisals a moot point  \\n since it's being done subtly throughout the year.  \\n Communication, we don't like to admit it, but in some cases  \\n performance appraisals are done to force managers to  \\n actually communicate better with their staff.  \\n I don't like to think sales managers have this issue  \\n but clearly some do.  \\n Communication is a critical element  \\n of the performance appraisal process.  \\n Coaching and training.  \\n I believe those who link coaching and training  \\n with performance management end up with appraisals  \\n that are so much more effective.  \\n It's a teamwork approach to develop career growth,  \\n motivation and sales results that creates a bond  \\n between manager and the salesperson.  \\n Objectives, this needs to be done in partnership  \\n and not just handed out from the human resources  \\n or senior department management.  \\n A manager and salesperson can agree  \\n on key objectives to focus on, evaluate regularly,  \\n and celebrate when they've been achieved.  \\n Too often objectives are seen as a negative chore rather  \\n than a positive task to help someone perform better.  \\n How we handle the performance evaluation and  \\n overall appraisal process is an important responsibility  \\n not just for the manager but the employee too.  \\n It can be seen  \\n and that's an opportunity to focus  \\n on enhancing the skills of each salesperson.  \\n When time and careful thought is given  \\n to the performance appraisal process  \\n it all ties back to the most important measurement objective  \\n of increasing revenue and profits.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2643931\",\"duration\":230,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Building effective incentive plans, compensation, and contests for your sales team\",\"fileName\":\"587596_en_US_01_04_2023Q1_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"With all the tracking and metrics available out there, you can create some detailed incentive programs.

We've hired good people  \\n and we're pushing them to perform  \\n at the top of their abilities,  \\n so we want to make sure the targets are aggressive but fair.  \\n Setting sales targets involves a number  \\n of steps depending on the company you work for.  \\n In a number of cases,  \\n you're given an overall number from management and finance.  \\n Hopefully, you're in a business where it's  \\n a more collaborative process  \\n and you work together to agree  \\n on a budget for the sales department.  \\n If you're given an overall five to 6% increase  \\n for your team, and if you wanted to just take the easy path,  \\n you could just pass up along to each salesperson  \\n and you're done.  \\n However, as we all know, that's not the way it works.  \\n You need to look at what accounts are growing rapidly,  \\n those that are flat  \\n and those that may be on a downward cycle.  \\n Being able to explain  \\n to each individual representative how you  \\n set their target means you need to have all  \\n of your ducks in a row.  \\n Being clear and communicating your sales  \\n target strategy openly is a critical objective.  \\n I think monitoring and tracking sales  \\n is the fun part of being a salesperson.  \\n Well, with the caveat when your business is healthy.  \\n Years ago, I used to track my sales performance  \\n with homemade tracking tools  \\n and kept it posted on my office wall.  \\n Some companies even still have war rooms  \\n with the numbers posted and filled  \\n in manually on a whiteboard or big chart.  \\n As spreadsheets improve,  \\n salespeople created their own charts  \\n and graphs with multiple colors.  \\n Today, with some terrific customer relationship  \\n management software, you can slice and dice results  \\n in many ways to track and evaluate your teams.  \\n It's also generated automatically,  \\n so everyone can see real time results.  \\n Tracking and monitoring can then be  \\n on a consistent timetable rather than quarterly or longer.  \\n This comes down to personal preference as a manager  \\n but I want salespeople totally focused  \\n on their overall number.  \\n This one is very straightforward  \\n and at a glance, they know exactly where they are  \\n year to date.  \\n Revenue tracking of a sales target  \\n is the primary performance indicator  \\n the KPIs for other aspects  \\n of the sales process are important measurements too.  \\n However, we can never lose sight  \\n of the individual quotas that each sales representative has.  \\n The achievement of that number  \\n is what drives our success or disappointment.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2647141\",\"duration\":207,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Expense targets\",\"fileName\":\"587596_en_US_02_02_2023Q1_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Managing expenses is as important as attaining a revenue goal.

What can be better  \\n than getting positive feedback from a customer?  \\n Actually, what's scarier is what can be worse  \\n than receiving bad news from an account?  \\n Without a doubt, the feedback we get from customers  \\n is an important performance element  \\n as we evaluate the success of salespeople,  \\n our companies, and the product or service we're selling.  \\n In fact, it's probably at the top of the list  \\n since customer acceptance ties directly  \\n to orders we receive,  \\n which means revenue on our balance sheets.  \\n I guess if we really wanted to streamline  \\n the whole measurement process,  \\n we could just focus on customer feedback.  \\n That's somewhat true,  \\n but actually could be a bit misleading,  \\n which is why it's just a piece  \\n of the overall performance evaluation,  \\n along with all the others we're reviewing in this course.  \\n There is some firm objective data we can get from customers,  \\n but there's also a lot of subjective feedback too.  \\n We need to review it all  \\n before reporting on it or making decisions.  \\n One of the best ways to get subjective feedback  \\n goes back to the basics of the sales process.  \\n By assessing the situation, gathering information,  \\n asking questions, and most importantly, listening.  \\n There are many ways to do this,  \\n but here are three that I found to be effective for me.  \\n Account visits, you don't get feedback sitting at your desk  \\n or mired in meetings at the corporate headquarters.  \\n Yes, you can pick up things by email or by telephone,  \\n but nothing beats the face-to-face contact  \\n with your accounts.  \\n Business reviews, I've always believed  \\n that these are some of the best meetings  \\n you can have with accounts.  \\n Given the work to prepare for them from both sides,  \\n you're limited with how many can be scheduled,  \\n but the open and direct feedback is worth so much.  \\n The objective is to review the current state of the business  \\n and find ways to grow it going forward.  \\n So much performance information is a part of this process.  \\n Conventions, industry functions,  \\n really subjective feedback here  \\n since you're often chatting with buyers and accounts  \\n in casual settings, ad hoc meetings,  \\n and in short timeframes.  \\n However, you'd be amazed at what you'll hear  \\n when people are out of their normal office settings.  \\n Ask questions and listen.  \\n Depending on the type of business you're in  \\n and sales structure, surveys to customers  \\n can provide some real objective feedback.  \\n However, there's more to this than just having a page  \\n of questions and requests for opinions.  \\n There's a real skill to developing a survey,  \\n asking for the right information and how to evaluate it,  \\n and the best ways to report on it.  \\n My recommendation is to proceed with caution,  \\n and definitely hire someone who's an expert and can assist.  \\n I mentioned earlier that the most obvious customer feedback  \\n comes back to tracking the sales results.  \\n If a salesperson's results are off  \\n compared with other territories, that's a signal.  \\n If they're always coming in second in the decision process,  \\n maybe their weak at closing.  \\n However, this indirect objective feedback from a customer  \\n can also be a reflection on your coaching  \\n and training or product or service offering.  \\n The feedback we get from customers is always valuable,  \\n and can be a very effective way to get a handle  \\n of what's happening on sales calls.  \\n However, it's also important to account  \\n for the many variables that can impact this feedback.  \\n The information you request and compile is critical data  \\n as part of our overall performance evaluation  \\n of our sales team and business.  \\n Asking questions and listening closely to our accounts  \\n is an ongoing responsibility that you always must do.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2643935\",\"duration\":213,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Effective use of promotions with accounts\",\"fileName\":\"587596_en_US_03_04_2023Q1_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Effective use of promotions with accounts ties in with expense management, but it is more closely associated with how your salespeople are using funds to promote new products, supporting new services, and taking advantage of materials provided by the marketing and promotion teams.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":11274687,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Very early in my career,  \\n I made a sales call before I had gone  \\n through the formal training program with my company.  \\n I was excited, energized, in my mind, fully prepared.  \\n So well prepared  \\n that I brought a separate salesman sample bag full  \\n of marketing materials, catalogs, sales sheets,  \\n and copies of all  \\n of the various promotional offers that we had available.  \\n It was quite a sight,  \\n and it did bring a smirk to my buyer's face.  \\n The evaluation and measurement  \\n of how salespeople put to use the promotions  \\n and collateral material developed  \\n is often seen as a subjective analysis.  \\n In many ways, it is,  \\n and certainly historically, that's been the case.  \\n In the example from my story,  \\n I was ineffective by bringing all of those materials  \\n and I chalk it up to a rookie mistake.  \\n However, through the years, most salespeople are accused  \\n of using collateral material at a bare minimum.  \\n The first step that needs to be done is a rigorous review  \\n of what's being created, what's needed, and what's used.  \\n That would also include the total budget and dollars spent.  \\n The sales, business development, finance  \\n and marketing management,  \\n all should participate in these discussions  \\n and get on the same page.  \\n When focused specifically on salespeople,  \\n you can examine a variety of variables  \\n based on your type of business  \\n and product or service offering.  \\n Some of the newer tracking systems  \\n even have features to examine promotional usage.  \\n Here are some examples that I've seen tracked  \\n and measured of critical marketing programs,  \\n and the salesperson's efforts to utilize them.  \\n Expense management, cooperative advertising,  \\n marketing funds.  \\n This is an essential training that you need  \\n to have regularly with your sales team.  \\n It should start right when they're hired  \\n and be an ongoing measurement.  \\n If you don't use cooperative advertising,  \\n then it's the use of marketing funds available.  \\n You set the parameters based on your style  \\n and company philosophy, and then review quarterly.  \\n Deals and offers.  \\n Programs to incentivize customers  \\n to place an order now, more aggressively,  \\n or to beat the competition aren't developed blindly.  \\n I found some salespeople pounce  \\n on these opportunities while others need more of a push.  \\n For me,  \\n I value those account managers who don't need to be prodded.  \\n Social media.  \\n Many salespeople are reluctant or not trained  \\n in the use of social media for selling purposes.  \\n Some are fully on board  \\n and you need to recognize those salespeople  \\n who are using social media to support their efforts.  \\n Sell-through analysis and ROI.  \\n It's the age-old sales and marketing question:  \\n we spent X amount of dollars,  \\n and what was the return on investment?  \\n It's easier to pinpoint  \\n in some industries compared to others,  \\n but it's one that you need to have always  \\n as a part of your performance measurement criteria.  \\n Remember, whatever materials we're creating  \\n or promotions we're developing,  \\n the purpose is to grow revenue.  \\n We can have the nicest looking collateral  \\n and attractive promotional programs,  \\n but if our customers don't want them  \\n or the salespeople don't use them, then there's a problem.  \\n It's a performance measure  \\n that the best salespeople have mastered  \\n because they know their customers' needs  \\n and how to support them to maximize sales.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

Excellent.  \\n Does that mean a lot to your buyer?  \\n - Oh yeah, it means a ton to him.  \\n His day is bombarded with inefficiencies,  \\n and also, their competition is over there touting speed.  \\n So being able to catch up with them  \\n and reduce the fire putting out on a daily basis,  \\n that would be huge.  \\n - Oh, perfect focus.  \\n Last question.  \\n How will he be more successful as a result  \\n of doing business with us?  \\n - Well, if he gets all these inefficiencies under control,  \\n he's going to look like a hero internally.  \\n But I also think, like I said,  \\n their competition is touting speed,  \\n and if we can help these guys speed up  \\n and reduce some of that friction,  \\n they are so much better positioned in the market  \\n with their customers.  \\n - All right.

 \\n Is there a problem that your product is solving  \\n that is important enough to fix now?  \\n Do they have the money to purchase the product?  \\n What's unique about your product  \\n that makes it the best fit for them?  \\n Keep these questions at your fingertips  \\n and try to uncover the answers with every prospect.  \\n The next step, prepare for your sales meeting.  \\n It takes an average of five to six people  \\n to make a buying decision,  \\n so do a pre call with your sponsor or champion  \\n before the group meeting.  \\n Find out what their team hopes to get out of the meeting.  \\n Find out what they believe the team needs  \\n to learn from you during the meeting  \\n to take the next steps.  \\n And find out what objections you're likely to face  \\n from the people who'll be in the room.  \\n Then, give a persuasive sales presentation.  \\n Most reps are really good at describing the product features  \\n but sometimes fail to connect the product features  \\n to the benefits the prospect will get  \\n from owning the product,  \\n and therefore, ultimately, the business value  \\n that the prospect will get.  \\n Here's the formula for how I do it.  \\n Our product does X, that's the feature,  \\n which allows you to do Y, that's the benefit,  \\n and that means Z in terms of real business value.  \\n Helping your prospects see your product this way  \\n makes you more persuasive.  \\n Onto the next stage and my personal favorite,  \\n overcoming objections.  \\n The best way to overcome sales objections  \\n is to not overcome them, and that seems contradictory right?  \\n But the key here is anticipation.  \\n Don't wait for your prospects to raise objections,  \\n raise them first and deal with them,  \\n that way you own the objection,  \\n which makes it way easier to overcome.  \\n For example, if you frequently get price objections,  \\n during your sales pitch, say something like,  \\n Mr. Prospect, a lot of people ask about price,  \\n and that's always an important thing to talk about,  \\n once you're using our product, the value's really clear,  \\n but like a lot of things in life,  \\n until it's up and running,  \\n there are always a lot of questions.  \\n And then, you demonstrate why  \\n the value they'll gain from your product  \\n will be much higher than the price that they pay.  \\n Next step is the follow-up.  \\n Follow up immediately after the first meeting  \\n and also, schedule out future follow ups  \\n in your calendar or CRM.  \\n Use these opportunities to reinforce your product's value,  \\n never just call to touch base or to check in.  \\n Provide real value with each interaction  \\n and always end the conversation  \\n with a clearly defined next step.  \\n Another step is negotiation.  \\n While negotiating, never offer a discount,  \\n instead offer an adjustment, meaning  \\n you aren't just lowering the price,  \\n but if you adjust the price down,  \\n it's an exchange for something else.  \\n For example, you can give a discount  \\n if a customer commits to an annual subscription  \\n or a contractual amount of product purchase  \\n over the course of a year.  \\n This creates a win win situation.  \\n Now, as a first step to improve your sales process,  \\n draft your own version of this pitch  \\n to be used in your next sales presentation.  \\n Our product does X, which allows you to do Y,  \\n and that means Z in terms of real business value for you.  \\n When you use this framework,  \\n your prospect can instantly see the value  \\n they stand to gain from their decision,  \\n which brings you that much closer to closing the deal.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2287502\",\"duration\":226,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Turn your top performers into coaches\",\"fileName\":\"2825124_02_03_MM30_Coaches\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"More often than not, the best sales coaches for your team are your own team members.

 \\n A final KPI, Net Promoter Score,  \\n this measures how likely customers are  \\n to recommend your product,  \\n often ranked from zero, not very likely,  \\n to 10, very likely.  \\n The simplest way to get this information is  \\n through a followup email after a product order  \\n or after they've used your product  \\n or service for a little while.  \\n These customers are then ranked by the scores they give.  \\n Promoters are those that give you a score of nine or 10.  \\n These customers are loyal,  \\n and they'll recommend your company to other people.  \\n Passives give a score of seven or eight.  \\n These customers are satisfied with your product,  \\n but they aren't enthusiastic.  \\n And they're more likely to leave  \\n if they receive a better offer from a competitor.  \\n Anyone who gives a score of six or less is a detractor.  \\n Compare your NPS over a period of time  \\n to see if your customers' experience  \\n with your product is creating promoters,  \\n and pay extra attention to those customers that are at risk.  \\n Now, for each of these KPIs, make a plan for one action  \\n that your team can take to make an improvement.  \\n This way, you can set specific and measurable goals  \\n for your team and improve your company's performance.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2287503\",\"duration\":196,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Leverage technology for better performance\",\"fileName\":\"2825124_03_03_MM30_Tech\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Successful salespeople don\u2019t get where they are simply because of luck.

 \\n Let me show you how I ensure  \\n that my team stays inspired and productive.  \\n The foundation for a motivated team lies in having a clear  \\n and achievable career development plan in place.  \\n Take a look at your sales department  \\n and ask yourself what are the different career paths  \\n available to my reps?  \\n Also ask is our compensation package structured in a way  \\n that motivates the reps?  \\n Ask am I setting challenging  \\n yet attainable goals for my team?  \\n Talk with your reps one-on-one on a regular basis  \\n about what they want to get out of their job and career.  \\n Depending on the career path  \\n that they envision for themselves,  \\n you can work together with your team  \\n to ensure they're on track to achieve their goals.  \\n But sometimes even reps that are happy  \\n with their career development end up feeling unmotivated.  \\n Maybe they feel unhappy with their team dynamics.  \\n Or maybe they feel like they need more training.  \\n Or maybe they don't feel valued or recognized.  \\n As a manager, there are some tiny steps that you can take  \\n to nip these problems in the bud.  \\n One great way to motivate your team  \\n is to host a lunch or dinner to celebrate  \\n when a rep wins a key deal or does something exceptional.  \\n By inviting the whole team,  \\n you instill a team-oriented mindset  \\n where everyone's rooting for each other.  \\n Additionally, this recognition makes reps feel valued  \\n and encourages them to work even harder.  \\n Attending sales conferences regularly  \\n is a great way for reps to learn  \\n about the latest developments in the industry.  \\n Plus, networking at these events  \\n will not only improve their performance,  \\n but it will help re-energize their drive  \\n and stay excited about their career in sales,  \\n which frankly in my opinion is a more challenging,  \\n but often more rewarding career path  \\n than a lot of other options.  \\n Another thing, people don't think about it,  \\n but the way a workplace is set up  \\n has a huge impact on a team's positivity.  \\n To create a comfortable atmosphere,  \\n your office should be well-lit and quiet,  \\n with comfortable furniture.  \\n You want to create a relaxing mood,  \\n which will help improve your team's focus and productivity.  \\n The less cluttered and claustrophobic  \\n your office is, the better.  \\n An open layout has the benefit of promoting conversation  \\n and collaboration, while a door and cubicle layout  \\n has better soundproofing.  \\n If you go open layout, make sure there are quiet rooms  \\n your reps can head to for important conversations,  \\n privacy and focus.  \\n I've always felt like nothing cheers people up like food.  \\n Everybody loves snacks, and I think it's important  \\n to always keep fresh and healthy food  \\n like nuts and fruit in the office  \\n for your team to keep sustained energy.  \\n I personally have hard-boiled eggs made everyday  \\n inside little egg steamers inside my offices, too.  \\n Coffee and tea are a must.  \\n A friend of mine's company  \\n took away the coffee to save a few bucks,  \\n and I'm pretty sure they're out of their minds  \\n because now everybody just walks to Starbucks twice a day.  \\n It must waste an hour for would have been 25 cents a coffee.  \\n Bar games like darts are another great way  \\n to give your reps a break.  \\n In my company we have a foosball table.  \\n It's very good for stretching your legs  \\n in between calls and taking your mind off the job  \\n for a few minutes.  \\n Another thought, every once in awhile reward your team  \\n with a quick getaway from the office.  \\n You don't have to go far or spend a lot of money.  \\n It can be a meal out, or getting some takeout food ordered  \\n for delivery to a nearby park.  \\n The point is to clear your team's mind  \\n and strengthen relationships.  \\n People are motivated to work  \\n where they have some real friends.  \\n I also feel like there's always a great reason  \\n to throw a potluck.  \\n Also, consider inviting your employees' family  \\n to join some activities.  \\n It's a great way for your team  \\n to get to know each other's lives outside of the office.  \\n Thinking of your own office and team,  \\n brainstorm one change you can make to your office  \\n and two activities you can do outside the office  \\n to motivate your sales team.  \\n These changes will ensure that your team remains engaged,  \\n energetic and productive.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2286606\",\"duration\":194,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"The importance of sales rep team building\",\"fileName\":\"2825124_04_04_MM30_TeamBuild\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"According to a recent poll, employees that feel connected to their team have 21% higher productivity rates.
