several decades,\\nthree major theories have become widely applied\\nto instruction design: behaviorism, cognitivism,\\nand constructivism.\\n\\nThese theories differ in their definition of learning,\\ntheir understanding of how learning happens,\\nthe factors that facilitate learning,\\nand how learning changes behavior and lifts performance.\\nAs a result, they each characterize the role\\nof the learner differently and prescribe different\\ninstructional methods to develop assessments\\nand measure their success.\\nEarly in the 20th century, psychologists suggested\\nthat human behavior, like that of animals,\\ncould be explained in terms of conditioning\\nwithout reference to thoughts or feelings.\\n\\nBasically, learning happened as a reaction\\nto external stimuli.\\nTouch a hot stove and you learn not to touch it again.\\nWhen you see a stop sign, you apply pressure\\nto your brake pedal.\\nWhen someone sneezes, you say gesundheit.\\nBehaviorism says that learning is the mastering\\nof predictable behaviors.\\nTherefore, the right instruction design will teach\\ndemonstrable skills that can be measured by observations.\\nWe apply this theory, for example, when we teach employees,\\nif you see something wrong, speak up.\\n\\nEventually, behaviorism was challenged\\nby a new generation of psychologists\\nwho argued that learning is a cognitive phenomenon\\nwhich happens when a learner receives, stores,\\nand retrieves information.\\nCognitivism was built upon the principles of behaviorism\\nbut focused less on stimulating observable behaviors\\nand more on how external mental models could be transferred\\nto the learner's mind.\\nWe apply this theory when we want people\\nto learn an organized set of facts and figures,\\nfor example, the rules and regulations\\ncontained in an employee handbook.\\n\\nConstructivism took cognitivism one step further\\nby asserting that people actively construct knowledge\\nin their own minds through problem-solving,\\nexperiential learning, and social learning.\\nIn this theory, learners are at the center\\nof the learning process and learn\\nby activating their own prior knowledge\\nand personal experience and looking at new information\\ncontextually and relative to their social environments\\nand interactions.\\nIn this way, learning happens as new knowledge\\nand experiences are adapted and integrated\\nwith a learner's existing mental models.\\n\\nConstructivism and various constructivist theories,\\nsuch as social constructivism, situated learning,\\nand

instructional designer does\\nor the complicated nature of an elearning production,\\nand rightfully so.\\n\\nThat's not their role.\\nBut it's up to us to inform them what's involved,\\nhow long it will take, how much it will cost,\\nand the details of the learning experience.\\nAnd a key part of that is the elearning storyboard.\\nI love storyboarding.\\nI love how you get a script and you pull it apart,\\nthink through the visuals that might show on screen\\nor the activities and the experience\\nthe learners might have.\\nBut the reality is, storyboarding is simply\\na communication tool, it's as simple as that.\\n\\nIt will define how the content will be presented\\nand how the learners will engage with it.\\nTo better understand storyboarding\\nin the context of elearning design,\\nlet's first discuss where storyboarding came from.\\nLet's go back in time for a second.\\nHistorically, storyboarding is defined\\nas a series of drawings or pictures\\nthat show the changes of a scene and action\\nof a movie or television show.\\nStoryboards originated in the motion picture industry\\nto help directors and cinematographers\\npre-visualize a film's scenes and sequence.\\n\\nWe think the first known use of storyboards\\nappeared in silent films in the early 1900s.\\nHowever, Christopher Finch in the Art of Walt Disney\\ncredits Disney animator Webb Smith\\nwith being the first to arrange a series of drawings\\nin sequence to tell a story,\\nthus creating the first storyboard as we know it today.\\nIn elearning development however, a storyboard looks\\na bit less like a cartoon panel\\nand more like a series of columns and rows\\nrepresenting the text, visuals, and actions\\nof a learning experience.\\n\\nIt's your key to establishing a course's narrative flow,\\ndefining the what, where, how, and why.\\nIn elearning design, we want to strive to show\\nmore than we tell, and a storyboard will define\\nwhat you will say and show on screen.\\nIt should outline specific visual elements\\nor any associated text.\\nA storyboard will also help you define\\nwhere the user will go next in every screen of the course.\\n\\nIt'll help you think through your branching logic.\\nYou need to be thinking at all times,\\nwhat is going to lead where and why?\\nAnd that why is so very important.\\nWhy should I show this on screen before that?\\nWhy do I want the text to appear this way versus that?\\nIn your storyboard design and development,\\nalways think beyond the how to the why.\\nThink of an elearning storyboard as a

audience\\nis all about developing empathy for your learners.\\nOnce you can put yourself in the learner's shoes,\\nyou can then begin to design an impactful experience\\nwith them in mind.\\n\\nOkay, back to our course scenario here,\\nwe've identified our audience as senior-level managers\\nwith at least five years experience in the role.\\nThey have a basic working knowledge\\nof coaching best

[Instructor] Once you have a solid understanding\\nof the business needs, and your target audience,\\nyou'll then need to translate them\\nto learning goals and performance objectives.\\nIt was the French writer and poet,\\nAntoine de Saint-Exupery that said,\\n\\\"A goal without a plan is just a wish.\\\"\\nSo goals are important, but what are they\\nand how do they differ from an objective?\\nThere are a few different ways\\nto think about goals and objectives,\\nbut here's how I see it.\\nA course goal indicates a broad learning outcome\\nstudents will acquire at the end of a course.\\n\\nSo imagine you're mapping a trip to a new location.\\nAnd the blue navigational line that appears on your Maps app\\nwould represent your goal.\\nSo your course goal indicates this big picture,\\nor that long-term view that gets one\\nfrom destination A to destination B.\\nThis will provide you with a clear direction\\nof where you're heading\\nand help you track progress along the way.\\nAll project goals should be specific,\\nrealistic, and attainable.\\nSo specific, the goal should target\\na specific area for improvement.\\n\\nRealistic, it should state\\nwhat can realistically be achieved\\ngiven the available resources.\\nAnd attainable, one actually has to be able\\nto achieve the goal given the parameters of the course.\\nThis should provide you with a clear direction\\nof where you're heading, and again, help you track progress.\\nOne approach to writing learning goals\\nis to frame them as responses to the phrase,\\nupon completion of this course, the target audience will.\\nSo for the purposes of our Coaching for Managers course,\\nthat could read, upon completion of this course,\\nthe learner will demonstrate effective coaching techniques.\\n\\nAnd unlike a goal, a course objective\\nindicates a specific learning outcome,\\nwhich is derived from the course goal,\\nand there are usually multiple course objectives.\\nSo back to the Maps example.\\nThe objectives will be the road markers or the highway exits\\nyou would pass along the way.\\nAll course learning objectives should be measurable,\\nwhich means you can track if the learner\\nreached the objective or not,\\nwhich makes it easy to observe\\nwhen a learner fails or succeeds.\\nAnd note that when all course objectives are met,\\ntheir corresponding goal should also be achieved.\\n\\nAn approach to writing learning objectives\\nis to frame them as responses to the phrase,\\nupon completion of this course\\nthe target audience will be able to.\\nSo back to our example, we could say,\\nupon completion of this course,\\nmanagers will be able to provide actionable feedback\\nto their teams across various steps\\nin the development process.\\nThat's specific, and something we can measure.\\nAnother tactic is to link the objective to performance.\\nSo think about what the learner\\nis actually going to be able to do\\nwith the skills and information once the course is done.\\n\\nSo you could say, identify opportunities\\nto coach teammates, and learn the steps\\nto providing actionable feedback.\\nAnd another way to think about this is to ask,\\nwhat's the desired outcome at the end of the e-learning?\\nI learned this from a colleague and never forgot it.\\nWhatever learning experience you're crafting,\\nthink through what do want people thinking,\\nfeeling, and doing differently\\nas a result of this experience.\\nThe mindset, the emotion, and the action.\\nSo why talk about goals and objectives\\nin a storyboarding course?\\nWell, because this should be your North Star.\\n\\nIt should guide all the decisions you make\\nregarding course development and design.\\nDefining the goals and objectives\\nwill guide the whole storyboarding process.\\nPrioritize your goals and objectives along the way,\\nto keep thinking through your learner's needs,\\nas you design your courses\\nand before you get started in on your

increased when information is shared with others.\\n\\nSo to make online learning sticky, one must feel\\nlike they're learning from a human being, an actual person\\nthey can relate to, not a bot under the screen.\\nSo if there's voiceover and someone else other than you\\nis going to deliver that script, make sure to coach them\\non a conversational and organic delivery.\\nThere's nothing worse than listening to online content\\nwhere the voiceover artist sounds like a robot.\\nPeople don't speak like that.\\nKeep it concise.\\nThe fact is, the learner is going to take time\\nout of

relevant content.\\nIf it can be said in less words, less text on screen,\\nor with less panels, do that.\\nThat's concise, right?\\nAnd make it visual.\\nOnline learners will remember your content\\nmore effectively if it paints a vivid picture.\\nSo instead of just telling them about an idea\\nor a concept with text, try to use imagery and graphics\\nto support your learning points whenever possible.\\n\\nA well-written elearning script has the power\\nto help someone transform and grow.\\nIt's so cool, I love that.\\nSo when you're writing or editing your scripts\\nremember,

the tool\\nthat is most comfortable for you to get your ideas out.\\n\\nWith that said, when selecting a tool\\nto design your slides or develop your boards,\\nthink about if you will be working on a team,\\nor taking on the project solo.\\nThis can guide your decisions moving forward.\\nIf you're working on a team,\\nGoogle Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides\\nto me are a no-brainer.\\nAnd maybe I'm biased here because this is what I mainly use,\\nbut the advantage is they allow to gather\\nreal-time feedback within the documents\\nusing the comments feature.\\nAnd if you're working

it.\\nBelieve it or not, we storyboard every live action\\ncourse here at LinkedIn Learning, and lynda.com in Excel.\\nThe advantage of PowerPoint though,\\nbesides the fact that it's a tool\\nyou might be used to using, is that you can upload\\nto articulate storyline with relative ease.\\nSo if that's your development tool of choice\\nthat would be a good call for you.\\nYou can export from Google Slides to PowerPoint,\\nbut some funky things happen to your text and graphics\\nsometimes when you do that.\\n\\nSo bake in time for some extra work\\nif you use Google Slides.\\nI actually

to be an Adobe Captivate user\\nto create storyboards with Adobe Captive Draft.\\nSo this is something you might want to look into,\\nor try out.\\nA final thing to consider\\nis what tools are your clients used to?\\nWhen I first started freelancing, I didn't know Articulate\\nvery well at all, but my main client's internal team\\nused it so I learned it in short order.\\n\\nSome companies will use proprietary applications as well.\\nJust consider, how are your SMEs\\ngetting the documents to you,\\nwhat applications they're using\\nand then choose appropriately.\\nRemember your storyboard

[Narrator] There are many different versions\\nof storyboards, storyboard templates out there.\\nJust Google it and you'll get a plethora of information.\\nFirst, let's note that every storyboard\\nshould contain some or all of the following information.\\nText based storyboards focus mainly on, well, text.\\nAnd they will have text written descriptions\\nof each asset or visual you'll see onscreen\\nand the audio to learner will hear.\\nText based boards are usually about Microsoft Word\\nor Google Docs in a table format\\nlike this one you see here.\\n\\nYou can see we start with the lesson title\\nto let everyone know what content\\nthe storyboard aligns with.\\nThere will usually be space for\\nthe screen number you're on so also drop\\nand hear the type of screen this is\\nsuch as a quiz or an activity.\\nThis column will give your developer any graphics notes\\nso if these are your visual instructions\\ndetailing what exactly the learner\\nwill be seeing on screen from a graphic perspective.\\nThis next column will contain the text onscreen,\\naligned with that visual.\\nIn this final column in our text based storyboards\\nwill contain any narration or audio script\\nif your e-learning has voiceover.\\n\\nNow as an instructional designer,\\nI think you should always be thinking visually\\nso even if you decide to use this template\\nI'd recommend still dropping in a visual\\nin the graphics note section for your developer.\\nHave them pull images from Google\\nor I just mock up some pen and paper sketches\\nlike this for my developers.\\nAnything you can use to help them\\nunderstand what vision you're trying\\nto get across will help make the collaboration\\nand the handoff more successful.\\nSo visual storyboards are usually built\\nin PowerPoint or Keynote\\nand this may sound obvious but they will\\nalways show what the learner's going to see onscreen.\\n\\nAnd I find that visual based storyboards\\nend up being closer to the final result\\nthan working in a table in a Word document.\\nHere's a template that I often use\\nif you're wanting to show more than you're telling\\nin your storyboards.\\nAnd this template is great if you have\\nan image heavy palette or if you have simple\\nto complex interactions that you need\\nto communicate to your\\nsubject matter experts and developers.\\nSo let's define some of these elements a bit further\\nand take a look at how they might make their way\\ninto this template.\\nI usually drop the project title area\\nin a screen title area at the top of a panel.\\n\\nI find this keeps everyone reviewing the boards\\non the same page and it avoids my own confusion too\\nwhen I have multiple storyboards and projects\\ngoing on at the same time.\\nThe screen number area is where you'll add\\na unique identifier for each screen\\nsuch as two of 20 for instance.\\nThis main section here is your area\\nto define the graphics or the visuals you envision.\\nThis is the visual of what the learner\\nwill see onscreen such as\\nan illustration, diagram or even a video.\\nAnd you can add in images of hand drawn thumbnails here,\\nscreen grabs of Google images\\nor often you're probably designing the slides as well.\\n\\nYou can drop those in as mock ups\\nor your close to final slides here.\\nIn align with that visual section,\\nyou'll also have a descriptor here\\nin the visual info section\\nwhere you can note any text onscreen\\nthat will appear with the visual.\\nYou could also describe any animations you'd like\\nto see here or any media files to hand off.\\nAgain, such as a PNG, a PSD or an Illustrator file.\\nSo the voiceover and audio section is where\\nyou would define your voiceover narration\\nor audio script.\\nYou can also add the name of a music file\\nyou'd like to play over the visuals onscreen\\nor something that's always fun to think through\\nis adding any sound effects in\\nbut don't overdo it with the sound effects though\\nas it can up the cheese factor a bit.\\n\\nOkay in the top right section of this template,\\nthe navigation area is where you can describe\\nany interactions that occur onscreen\\nor define where the user will go next\\nwhich could include a video, quiz or a scenario.\\nInteractions, this is the good stuff\\nin e-learning design.\\nInteractivity has proven to have a significant impact\\non the effectiveness of the learning and e-learning process.\\nSo when you say something is interactive\\nyou're basically defining the dialogue\\nbetween the learner and the tool\\nfrom which the learner will engage in the process.\\n\\nAnd ultimately, learn something new.\\nSo you could use the Nav area to describe\\nany branching that may occur as well.\\nBranching differs a bit from interactions\\nas it refers to navigating the whole system.\\nSo to simplify this, just think of the next\\nand back buttons as well as any result\\nof a user interaction.\\nSo for example, if a learner fails a knowledge check,\\nor clicks on a link, this would define\\nwhere they are taken.\\nSo you can see in this example\\nwe're on slide one and next up would be slide two.\\nAnd then the user would advance the screen.\\n\\nYou can drop that section in here if you'd like.\\nI think that looks pretty nice up there.\\nOkay, last but not least\\nwe have the space for any reviewer comments.\\nAs I mentioned, I asked my team\\nto just leave feedback via Google Comments\\non the slide.\\nBut if you're using PowerPoint or Keynote,\\nthis could be a great place to keep track\\nof all the comments and changes\\nthat need to be addressed.\\nSo I highly recommend you take these templates\\nand make them your own.\\nEvery project is going to be different\\nand I'm constantly taking templates\\nand adding new sections and tweaking them\\nto work for the needs of the project.\\nMost storyboards though will probably\\nhave a mix of both text and visual based storyboards\\nand my recommendation, just fully think through\\nyour project first with a pen and paper.\\n\\nJust get down and get to work, scratch it out.\\nThis will allow you to be kind of

[Instructor] A key part of the storyboarding process\\nis the slide design.\\nAs you're thinking through your designs remember,\\nthe design should appeal to the target audience\\nthe instruction is trying to reach.\\nRecently, I was creating a course for high level managers\\nat a large organization and we used these illustrations\\nthat were fun, but they were somewhat elementary\\nin their character design.\\nAnd the feedback on our first round\\nwas that the graphics felt childish, eurgh right?\\nI totally understood what they meant too,\\nand so we designed a few more modern,\\nprofessional looking slides to complement the course.\\n\\nTo avoid that, here's some simple\\nuniversal design principles to think about\\nwhen designing your slides\\nand thinking through your visuals.\\nHierarchy is a type of graphical system for organizing type\\nthat establishes an order, allowing the reader\\nto easily find what they're looking for\\nand navigate the content.\\nNotice the organization here in this slide design.\\nYou have the header at the top\\nsectioned off with a color box for contrast,\\nyou have a subhead in bold 24 point font.\\nAnd then another second level in 18 point,\\nand if you need to go another level down,\\nyou can use the bullet with 15 point.\\n\\nI do my best not to reach this third level bullet point\\nwith text based slides, but it's there if you need it.\\nThis is a clean and simple design and easy to read.\\nBut what if you needed more text on screen?\\nThis is a comparison slide of text\\nusing a two column layout.\\nNotice there's a potential here\\nto have a lot of text onscreen,\\nwhich you should generally try to avoid,\\nbut the fonts are sizes that would make you\\nneed to be concise with what you show.\\nThat's a systematized and purposeful, creative constraint.\\nOn a slide like this, keep your word count down\\nand support the text with narration whenever possible.\\n\\nAlong with hierarchy is color.\\nYou could spend a lifetime studying color theory,\\nit's so fascinating, but for our purposes\\nsimply think about using color to direct attention.\\nThis can help your elearning reduce boredom and passivity,\\nand improve attention, readability and comprehension.\\nSo take a look at this example\\nfor our coaching for managers scenario.\\nWhether it's art, design, or a slide,\\npeople will look at the brightest object on screen.\\nHere I like the layout, it has a balance to it\\nbut you can see nothing really stands out.\\n\\nAnd I think timely, actionable, and consistent\\nare the keywords here.\\nSo let's make that pop by turning the other words orange\\nwhich has been identified as a color\\nthat we could use in this palette.\\nAnd now take a minute to look at this screen.\\nThe eye is directed to those keywords\\nin a clean, simple format.\\nI like that, slightly less opaque\\nthan the orange on the main text.\\nAnd reduce the brightness of the white here on that text\\nto send it back a bit.\\nNow we have achieved a nice balance of hierarchy and color\\nto guide the learner's attention\\nfrom top left to bottom right,\\nwhich is how learners read in the west.\\n\\nLet's move on to a sub-note of color, which is contrast.\\nThink contrast at all times.\\nDark backgrounds require a light text,\\nand light backgrounds require dark text.\\nThis will create the optimal visual experience\\nfor your audience.\\nHere is an example of a slide using color, hierarchy,\\nand contrast to guide the learner's eye from the text\\nto a video or image that will support\\nthis section's learning goals.\\nAnother important part of instructional design\\nis the use and layout of your visual elements.\\n\\nSo how you design your screen tells your learners\\nwhere to look and what's most important.\\nRemember you want the information on screen\\nto support the learning objectives of the course.\\nLet's take a look at this example,\\nI've seen stuff like this on storyboards\\nand it's like, what is happening here?\\nThe screen is trying to show ambulance aids\\nthat they should stand behind a moving vehicle.\\nBut the visual hierarchy here is not doing that justice.\\nSometimes the client might ask you to shake things up a bit,\\nor change the colors, or add in new graphics,\\nrefrain from that, keep it simple.\\n\\nThat can actually have a negative impact\\non how learners process the information.\\nHere's how I would redesign this.\\nRemove the extraneous items, like the bullhorn.\\nChange the background from that bright yellow,\\nremember light objects on dark backgrounds for contrast.\\nResize the guy, so he's at a more normal size.\\nAlways be careful when showing\\nwhat not to do in your e-learnings.\\nThe reality is, people will only remember a small percentage\\nof what they see and hear in your course,\\nso show the positive example,\\nin case that's the only thing\\nthey remember 10 weeks from now.\\n\\nAnd when you place graphics on screen,\\nyou can't assume that the learner\\nautomatically understands what they mean.\\nSo to guide the learner's understanding here,\\nI think we need a bit more information\\nso I added in a text box.\\nNotice the slight orange outline,\\nand the subtle drop shadow on the back of the text box\\nto make it pop.\\nI like to keep the navigation indicators simple\\nand I usually try to avoid\\nhaving large, obnoxious previous and next buttons\\nat the bottom of my screens.\\nSo now this has a nice use of hierarchy, color,\\nlayout and navigation.\\n\\nThere's simple graphics, yes,\\nbut they're very easy to follow.\\nSo you don't need to be a professional designer,\\nhowever to craft and effective elearning course,\\nit's really important to understand the basics of design.\\nWe've just scratched the surface here,\\nthere are numerous courses here for you to learn more.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:803863\",\"duration\":249,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Storyboarding example: Intro and

to do is figure out\\nthe visual style we're going for here.\\nAnd so, one thing I'll do sometimes\\nis start with a template design\\nthat I think is going to work well.\\nThe Google Slides templates are free\\nand have actually gotten quite good these days.\\nSo, we can use it as a starting point here,\\nand then adapt it to the course instruction.\\n\\nThis works if you don't have a graphic

template.\\nI created this in Google Slides,\\nand it can be adapted to PowerPoint very easily.\\nA version of this template is where I start\\nmost of my projects because it allows\\nfor simple to

add the text on screen for the intro slide here.\\nI like to do this so there's no confusion from what's\\nin the script to what's getting translated into visuals.\\nOK, so now, let's add the header slide\\nin that I designed on the side here.\\nNotice we're keeping it simple,\\nand we have a Start button to guide people in.\\n\\nWe'll need some navigation information here\\nfor our developer, so let's add that in, as well.\\nWe could say once the user is ready,\\nthey'll click the Start button to begin.\\nThen could add click Start to advance to the next slide.\\nPretty simple.\\nThen, regarding the visual info and media,\\nthis is the starter slide.\\nSo, I'll just let the developer know\\nit was designed in Google Slides.\\nBut I'd like to have a little bit\\nof fun here, so I'm leaving this note:\\nLet's have a light, subtle highlight\\naround the Start button, fading in and out\\nat an even pace, calling learners to dive in.\\n\\nIt's important to note here that certain things\\nare necessary to learning objectives\\nand other things are more for visual engagement.\\nThis would be a nice to have.\\nOK, on to the next panel.\\nLet's copy and paste the script\\ninto the description section.\\nNow, let's go out and snag\\nthe introduction slide I designed.\\nI usually just take screen grabs\\nof the designs and paste them in here.\\nAnd as you can see, this design is clean,\\nit's modern, it clearly articulates the section,\\nduration, and key topics using\\ntypographic hierarchy, as well as color.\\n\\nYou'll see we have a study guide\\nto download out here, as well.\\nAnd then the navigation to begin the lesson\\nis nice and clear, with a slight drop shadow.\\nThere's a solid hierarchy of information\\nguiding the learner along.\\nAnd let's be clear on what text\\nto show on screen and add that in.\\nAnd notice that will differ from the script section.\\nThen, again, add the navigation info.\\nWe'll say click Begin Lesson\\nto start to advance to the next slide.\\nAnd clicking Download study guide will auto-download a PDF.\\n\\nAdd any visual or media information\\nthat would be good to note here;\\nfor instance, the location of the study

up a notch here\\nand dive into storyboarding something a bit more complex,\\nlike an animation.\\nAdding in animations are a great way\\nto keep your learners engaged.\\nSo we create learning experiences for busy people.\\nThe fact is that the adult learners\\nviewing our courses usually are strapped for time,\\nbut they're also looking for something\\nto improve their skillset\\nor refresh their knowledge of a concept.\\n\\nAnd adding in animations and interactions to your eLearning\\nhas the ability of increasing knowledge transfer\\nin a fast-paced learning environment.\\nSo let's storyboard an animation.\\nWe're still building out our Coaching for Managers course,\\nand this is the script we were given\\nfrom our subject matter expert.\\nFor the purposes of this movie,\\nlet's say we do not have a visual look and feel\\nmapped out yet and we'll be able to use a voiceover.\\nSo okay, take a moment to review this content.\\nFeel free to pause the video if you have to.\\n\\nSo do you have ideas about how you would storyboard this?\\nWhat template would you use to communicate your vision?\\nAfter reading through the script,\\nI decided that this template was the best option\\nfor this type of content, based on the fact that for me,\\nit's the most versatile template.\\nAnd I had an idea while reading the script\\nto animate a timeline graphic here,\\nand I thought that this would be the best way to communicate\\nmy vision to the reviewers and the developer.\\nSo this is an image I sketched up on the back of a napkin\\nin a coffee shop.\\n\\nIn this situation, we haven't quite figured out\\nthe visual look and feel.\\nSo in the spirit of being agile and sharing early and often,\\nthis was the quickest way to get this mocked up\\nand out for review.\\nAnd I love drawing and thinking through ideas visually\\nwith the hand before I take it to the screen.\\nIt's just a fast and a fun way to get thoughts out on paper.\\nSo take a look at our template and add in a lesson title\\nand the screen title at the top here.\\nWe'll call this Screen number three out of 25,\\nand now let's add in the text to the boards here\\nin the Voiceover/Audio section.\\n\\nNotice that I needed to tweak this section size a bit\\nto fit all of that text, and that's okay.\\nYou will constantly be tweaking sections\\nto fit your descriptions.\\nOkay, now let's add in the image I mocked up\\nbased off of our back of the napkin sketch\\ninto the storyboard template.\\nSo I think this gets my idea across fine.\\nI'm thinking a timeline graphic again\\nthat will advance kind of along this dotted line\\nfrom left to right\\nas the voiceover reads through each section.\\nAlso, I like how the image fits into this template nicely.\\nThis template is really made for visuals\\nand it's sized appropriately.\\n\\nNow that our visuals are in there,\\nlet's add in the navigation information here.\\nSo let's say the slide advances by user\\nand the next slide equals SBI scenario.\\nSo this indicates the user will click to advance\\nand that the next slide is going to be a deeper dive\\non that second graphic and text,\\nthe situation behavior impact scenario.\\nIn the Visual Information, this is where I would describe\\nthe animation for the reviewer or developer.\\nIf there are specific graphics or visuals you have in mind,\\nalways drag them down and leave the location at the top\\nfor the developers.\\n\\nSo in this case, I would grab these icon images\\nalong the dotted line and drop them in their location\\nand add that note here.\\nFor the description, let's say\\nstart with the people speaking\\nin the top right and left corners.\\nHave the dotted line and associated graphics\\nand text dissolve on from left to right\\nwhen mentioned in the voiceover.\\nSo looking at the visual,\\nwe can start to kind of see this come together.\\nAnd if we wanted to add a bit of interactivity here,\\nwe could have additional information appear,\\nmaybe as the user hovers over each circle or graphic.\\n\\nNow let's add in the exact text on screen to appear.\\nThis is important in a case like this\\nbecause all the developer would see at this point\\nis my chicken-scratch handwriting and this hand-drawn image.\\nSo notice I had to bump this section up a bit\\nto account for all of this text,\\nbut hopefully this paints the picture\\nfor the developer enough.\\nI always struggle with how much or how little\\nto write in cases like this,\\nbut I think my rule of thumb here\\nis to be as concise but clear as possible.\\nYou don't want to write a book here, but if needed,\\nyou could leave additional notes\\nin the Speaker Notes section of PowerPoint\\nor Google Slides and I might write something like\\nSee Speaker Notes section for more information\\nhere at the bottom.\\n\\nOkay, this is one way to storyboard an animation.\\nTake a look back at that script\\nand see if any ideas pop in your

topic.\\nSo, if they click on a answer,\\nthere should be a corresponding action\\nto give them some feedback\\nor develop their knowledge further.\\nWhen you're crafting your scenario, keep it realistic.\\n\\nMake it about real-world situations over theory.\\nThink about, what are the core skills\\nthat they want to develop?\\nWhat real-world challenges do learners face\\nin their actual working environments?\\nIn keeping with our project theme of coaching for managers,\\nthe idea for this scenario is a real-world conversation\\nbetween a manager and their employee.\\nSo, in our hypothetical situation here,\\nwe didn't get much feedback from our\\nsubject matter expert on this.\\nThey basically just said, \\\"It would be great\\n\\\"to have some kind of a scenario here around

learner some additional and valuable information,\\nnot just sharing the correct answer.\\n\\nThink of time when you were taking a course\\nand you made a selection, and then you get the feedback\\nthat was like, that's incorrect, try again.\\nIt's kind of a bummer, right?\\nIt makes you feel like you're not getting it\\nor you're doing something wrong.\\nSo giving your learners here some additional content\\nwill just add educational value to the course,\\nand help your learners gain confidence.\\nSo here's the feedback we would add in for these answers.\\nTo keep this simple,

communicating with stakeholders\\nfor your e-learning projects.\\nTo start, clearly define the purpose of the meeting.\\nIs it to validate your designs or project direction?\\nAnd if so, define what specific parts of the course\\nor process you want to validate.\\nOr is it discovery?\\nAs in, you're in the project but you're a bit lost\\nand you need to realign your ideas\\nagainst the project goals.\\n\\nOr is it to facilitate collaboration?\\nSo if so, a project walk through might be appropriate here\\nwhere you can highlight specific sections of the course\\nand facilitate a brainstorming session.\\nComing to any stakeholder meeting with half-baked ideas\\nis just not acceptable.\\nBe prepared to tell a convincing story.\\nYou should be able to clearly and concisely\\ntell your course's narrative.\\nThen, explain how it addresses\\nthe course goals and objectives.\\nWhen you're preparing for the review meeting,\\nthink about what input do you need\\nto make the project more successful?\\nSo what are those elements that could potentially\\nunlock your roadblocks?\\nBe prepared to respond to any objectives\\nyou may be expecting.\\n\\nSo as you're going through your storyboards,\\ntake an empathetic approach\\nand think about your stakeholder's perspective\\nand their priorities.\\nSo what will they be thinking,\\nfeeling, and reacting to along the way?\\nTry to understand their motivations,\\ntheir interests, and their constraints.\\nSo what's driving them,\\nand what's potentially holding them back?\\nDuring the meeting, much like how you go about\\nbuilding a course, a good meeting presentation\\nbegins with the big picture, lay the context.\\n\\nAnd then, narrow it down into the specifics.\\nMake sure to get to the why,\\nso before diving into the how and the what,\\nshare your course learning goals and objectives,\\nand be ready to clearly communicate\\nhow this will not only fit into the course\\nbut also fit into the bigger picture,\\ncompany business goals and objectives.\\nBe clear and concise in your communication,\\nso they walk away understanding your ideas,\\nyour strategy, and you end up\\nwith approvals to move forward.\\nIf you can't communicate the ideas\\nbehind your storyboard designs concisely,\\nthen you probably haven't done the upfront work properly.\\n\\nIronically, it takes time and preparation\\nto be clear and concise.\\nAnd use active listening to understand,\\nrespond to, and articulate your stakeholder's point of view.\\nSome sentence starters you can use here are,\\nin other words, or if I can summarize your position.\\nThese types of phrases will validate all assumptions\\nand verify that you understand the feedback.\\nAlso, ask lots of follow up questions,\\nsuch as, what do you currently like and dislike\\nabout the storyboards, the designs, or the course?\\nWhat information is not included that should be included?\\nAnd you can say, do you feel like this addresses\\nand will impact our shared learning goals?\\nAnother question I love to ask at the end of meetings is,\\nis there anything else I should know?\\nIt usually catches people a bit off-guard,\\nbut it opens up for them to talk about\\nanything that may have been simmering\\nin the back of their mind during your presentation,\\nor as you were reading through your storyboards,\\nor going over your designs.\\n\\nIn all cases, lean towards actionable goals.\\nWhat you want from your communications\\nwith your stakeholders are solid takeaways\\nso that you can get back\\nto designing impactful learning experiences.\\nAlso, this usually doesn't happen in one meeting.\\nIt's usually a continuous cycle\\nwith at least two, if not more rounds of feedback,\\nand multiple Slack messages or emails,\\nso be open to iterating on the fly.\\nAnd respond promptly.\\nGo above and beyond in your follow up.\\nThe whole point of a stakeholder analysis and feedback loop\\nis to validate your design decisions\\nand get everyone on the same page.\\n\\nFrom your insights gleaned, to the final outcome.\\nSo understanding these things will help you understand,\\nprepare for, and deliver delightful learning experiences\\nfor your company and your clients.\\nTake that time to really kind of dive\\ninto the needs and the feedback.\\nThis will

A 2.5% sales increase is still pretty good.  \\n It works out to $150,000 per year for five stores.  \\n Good, right?  \\n Well, the chief financial officer might point out  \\n that we're using revenue for our calculation,  \\n not gross profit.  \\n Gross profit is revenue minus the cost of goods sold.  \\n Here's what happens when we use gross profit  \\n for our ROI calculation.  \\n Let's say the average gross profit  \\n at our retail stores is 35%.  \\n We can multiply this by our pilot revenue gain of $150,000  \\n to see a $52,500 annual gross profit gain.  \\n To calculate ROI,  \\n we subtract the $25,500 program cost from the $52,500 gain  \\n and then divide that number by the cost of the program.  \\n This yields 106% return on investment.  \\n Okay, all this math might make your head hurt a little,  \\n but it explains how executives and trainers  \\n often see things differently.  \\n A trainer might say,  \\n \\\"Hey, this new sales training program  \\n increased sales by $150,000.\\\"  \\n An executive might say,  \\n \\\"Well, according to my math, we only gained $27,000.\\\"  \\n Now, this was a pilot with five stores.  \\n Let's look at the projected ROI  \\n if we roll it out to all 100 stores in the chain.  \\n We'll take the $5,100 training cost per store  \\n and multiply that by 100 stores.  \\n Next, we'll multiply that $510,000 total cost  \\n by the 106% ROI to get an expected net gain of $540,600.  \\n Okay, now I know again, that's a lot of math,  \\n so I've put all the numbers for this example  \\n on the downloadable sample ROI calculation worksheet.  \\n You won't use the ROI model for every training program,  \\n but this example highlights a situation  \\n where it can be very helpful.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3072565\",\"duration\":191,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Brinkerhoff's Success Case Method\",\"fileName\":\"479801_en_US_01_03_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about the Success Case Method.

 \\n Now we need decide how we'll capture this data.  \\n We can measure turnover by analyzing data  \\n from our company's human resources  \\n information system, or HRIS.  \\n One way to know if supervisors  \\n are following the new procedures  \\n is to ask regional managers  \\n to observe their supervisors conducting interviews.  \\n Conducting mock interviews at the end of the training class  \\n will let us know whether supervisors learn  \\n to follow the new procedures.  \\n And we can give supervisors a short post-training survey  \\n to gauge how much they like the new procedures  \\n and how they reacted to the training.  \\n You can download the sample evaluation plan file  \\n to see the entire sample strategy  \\n for this interviewing skills project.  \\n Now, I encourage you to create an evaluation strategy  \\n for one of your training projects.  \\n You can download the evaluation strategy checklist  \\n to use as a guide.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3068505\",\"duration\":104,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Gain support for your evaluation plan\",\"fileName\":\"479801_en_US_02_03_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Explore the steps you should take to get buy-in from project sponsors and create your evaluation plan.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":1606993,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Once you create an evaluation strategy,  \\n you'll need to get buy-in  \\n from your project sponsor.  \\n Here are a few steps you should take.  \\n The first step is to summarize  \\n your evaluation strategy  \\n in a clear plan that can be shared  \\n with your project sponsor,  \\n and other key stakeholders.  \\n Here are a few things you might include  \\n in your plan.  \\n A project description.  \\n Your measurement goals.  \\n The evaluation strategy.  \\n A data collection plan  \\n that includes timeframes.  \\n A list of project team members,  \\n and your communication plan.  \\n Once you complete a written plan,  \\n it's important to share it  \\n with your project sponsor,  \\n and other key stakeholders to get their buy-in.  \\n Let's imagine we've created  \\n a strategy to evaluate  \\n an interviewing skills training program.  \\n You can download my sample evaluation plan  \\n to see all the details and use it  \\n as a guide for creating your own plan.  \\n I shared this plan with Stacy Jones,  \\n the project sponsor to get her buy-in.  \\n We walked through the measurement steps,  \\n and I explained how we could use it  \\n to make sure the training program  \\n met her objectives.  \\n We also read upon a timeline  \\n for reporting back on the results.  \\n Keep in mind,  \\n there are often multiple stakeholders  \\n for measurement projects like this one.  \\n For example,  \\n workshop includes having regional managers  \\n observe their supervisors  \\n conducting interviews  \\n to make sure they're using the new process.  \\n I'll need to share my plan  \\n with those regional managers to make sure  \\n they're on board.  \\n Evaluating a training program  \\n can take time, money and resources.  \\n So it's important to get your sponsors buy-in  \\n for your plan  \\n before you implement it.  \\n As a next step,  \\n I recommend creating an evaluation plan  \\n for one of your training programs,  \\n and sharing it with a sponsor  \\n to get their approval.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3073541\",\"duration\":130,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Manage data collection\",\"fileName\":\"479801_en_US_02_04_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn how to collect and manage the data required for your evaluation projects.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":1986037,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Once you create a strategy to evaluate  \\n your training program, you have to implement your plan.  \\n There are a few things you should do  \\n in this stage of the process.  \\n Apply consistent and accurate methods,  \\n monitor ongoing data collection,  \\n and document the data in a format that's easily accessible,  \\n like a spreadsheet or database.  \\n Let's use an interviewing skills training program  \\n as an example to illustrate  \\n how these considerations come into play.  \\n Our overall goal is to reduce turnover among new hires  \\n within their first 90 days from 30% down to 15%.  \\n We can measure this by analyzing data in our company's  \\n human resources information system, or HRIS.  \\n This is a database that contains  \\n all sorts of employee information,  \\n but how do we know that data is accurate?

 \\n The cool thing about digital learning is  \\n that it often takes place where a worker does their work,  \\n for instance, a newly hired service technician  \\n demonstrating on-the-job competency  \\n by knocking items off a checklist  \\n or perhaps a software engineer posting a technical question  \\n on the company's social site.  \\n In either case, the learning is baked into the work,  \\n and that makes it more relevant and more valuable.  \\n And finally, digital learning jives  \\n with the way everyone learns today.  \\n When you need to learn something, where do you go first?  \\n My hunch is Google or YouTube.  \\n And it's not just adults.  \\n My nine-year-old spends a good chunk  \\n of her day learning digitally,  \\n in particular, developing reading and math skills.  \\n There are many, many benefits  \\n for including aspects of digital learning,  \\n extended reach, reduced costs,  \\n incorporating learning into the workplace, and many others.  \\n Which resonate most with you  \\n and the needs of your organization?

 \\n Tip two: break participants into small groups.  \\n Small group discussions and activities are great.  \\n They're often more intimate,  \\n they create some variety  \\n and the students learn from each other.  \\n Most virtual learning platforms  \\n have this functionality built in.  \\n If the one you're using doesn't, create a workaround.  \\n Tip three: regularly check in with participants.  \\n You don't have the luxury of having everyone  \\n in the same room,  \\n so you're going to have to check in with students  \\n a bit more than normal.  \\n Call them by name,  \\n ask them to turn on their webcam when speaking,  \\n encourage them to respond verbally or through the chat.  \\n If you want to check in with all students  \\n to see how well they're understanding things,  \\n offer up a poll.  \\n Tip four: include additional resources  \\n that complement the session  \\n that learners can check out on their own.  \\n This might be material from LinkedIn Learning,  \\n online modules, blog posts from leaders in the field.  \\n This will give you stuff to talk about  \\n during your next session.  \\n And tip five: keep sessions on the shorter side.  \\n The longest you want to go is 90 minutes.  \\n It's way better to have multiple sessions per week  \\n than one long honking one.  \\n Keeping them shorter will also make recording  \\n and uploading the sessions easier.  \\n We've covered a decent amount of ground there,  \\n so let's sum up.  \\n Virtual instruction is effective  \\n when students need immediate feedback  \\n and the chance to collaborate.  \\n When you design them, remember to:  \\n create activities that encourage participation,  \\n check in with students often  \\n and keep sessions on the shorter side.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319270\",\"duration\":181,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Technical tips and tools: Virtual instructor-led training\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_03_03_XR30_technical\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5488768,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] We want to deliver  \\n high quality Virtual Training  \\n and we want to look and sound good while doing it.  \\n To achieve these worthwhile goals,  \\n there are a few technical things  \\n concerning how we present ourselves  \\n and the tools we use that we need to know.  \\n Let me start with a few tips  \\n that will allow us to present ourselves  \\n in the best professional light.  \\n My first suggestion is to invest in a quality microphone,  \\n and of course run your session from a quiet room.  \\n Good headset mics aren't expensive,  \\n and will yield far better quality  \\n than the mic on your computer.  \\n They are also better at filtering out background noise,  \\n which you always want to minimize.  \\n Position your webcam so that you're looking up slightly  \\n when you look into it.  \\n This angle simulates eye contact  \\n and is more flattering as you'll have  \\n fewer shadows on your face.  \\n Also, make sure your face is well lit.  \\n Natural soft light is best,  \\n say from a window across the room.  \\n If that's not an option,  \\n place a lamp in front of you so as to illuminate your face  \\n and remove unflattering shadows.  \\n It'll take a few practice recordings to get your sound,  \\n camera angle, and lighting just right.  \\n But I'm confident that you'll quickly  \\n achieve a professional setup.  \\n Okay, now let's turn to tools.  \\n It's hard to do quality work without quality tools.  \\n Some of the more popular conferencing tools  \\n like Zoom and Google Meet are easy to use,  \\n but they're really built for meetings rather than training.  \\n But I get it, sometimes you got to use  \\n what the company tells you to.  \\n If you must use a platform that doesn't offer much  \\n in the way of training functionality,  \\n you're at least going to want to  \\n quizzing and polling application.  \\n For quizzing, I recommend Kahoot.  \\n A game based quizzing application,  \\n which participants have a lot of fun with.  \\n And for polling your participants, I recommend Slido.  \\n Both are low to no cost apps.  \\n Now, if you want to master the virtual training format,  \\n you're going to need a platform built for training.  \\n The two platforms I recommend are GoToWebinar and Webex.  \\n Both companies have been in the training space a long time,  \\n have robust features, as well as solid customer service.  \\n Whatever virtual platform you use,  \\n get intimate with all its functionality.  \\n Can you break participants into chat rooms?  \\n Can you offer quizzes and polls on the fly?  \\n Get into the software and play around,  \\n look under every nook and cranny.  \\n Research how creative people are using the platform.  \\n As you can tell, there's a decent amount of technology  \\n involved in virtual instruction.  \\n But mastering it comes down to two basic things.  \\n Setting up your audio and webcam  \\n so you look and sound your best,  \\n and getting to know your platform tools really well.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2320929\",\"duration\":172,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Development tips: Elearning\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_03_04_XR30_development\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Explore best practices and commonly used tools for building traditional elearning.

 \\n By assessing what your students actually learn.  \\n So let's go over some of the ways you can measure  \\n what your learners have learned.  \\n Okay, most of us are teaching students how to do work tasks,  \\n so one obvious way to measure what students learn  \\n is to see how well they perform those tasks on the job.  \\n A checklist is a popular way to do this.  \\n Let's say you create a video  \\n that shows warehouse specialists how to do specific tasks  \\n with the forklift.  \\n To assess how well they do those tasks,  \\n You create a checklist of tasks  \\n and have a supervisor administer it in the warehouse.  \\n A second way we can gauge our students' knowledge  \\n is to have them perform work tasks in an environment  \\n that's pretty close to the real work environment.  \\n This is called a simulation.  \\n For example, a roleplay,  \\n say one based on a selling situation  \\n that's performed by knowledgeable, engaged players  \\n is pretty darn close to the real thing.  \\n A third way you gauge knowledge is through scenarios.  \\n When you create a scenario,  \\n you describe a real-life work situation through text,  \\n images, video, and then you ask your student  \\n what they should do given that situation.  \\n For example, in a management fundamentals course,  \\n the setup might be, Jenny,  \\n who has always been a solid performer on your team  \\n has been late to work four out of the last five days.  \\n How should you approach her about that issue?  \\n You see scenarios all the time in e-learning.  \\n Last, you can gauge your students' knowledge  \\n through traditional tests.  \\n Even though a test is far removed from the work environment,  \\n it's still an efficient and effective way  \\n to assess what students have learned.  \\n Alright, to just sum this up,  \\n there are four ways you can assess the learner's knowledge.  \\n You can assess it through on-the-job tasks.  \\n You can assess it in an environment  \\n that's pretty close to the real work environment,  \\n we call this a simulation.  \\n You can assess it in a scenario.  \\n And finally, you can assess it through a traditional test.  \\n If you'd like to learn more about assessment,  \\n I strongly recommend Sharon Schrock  \\n and William Coscarelli's book  \\n \\\"Criterion-Referenced Test Development.\\\"  \\n It certainly shaped my thinking on the subject.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319273\",\"duration\":178,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Assess performance through on-the-job checklists\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_04_02_XR30_checklists\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about best practices for building on-the-job checklists that allow you to assess workers' skills.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5450253,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] The best way to assess  \\n how well a student can perform  \\n the work task we're teaching them  \\n is to have them perform it on the job.  \\n This is commonly done through on-the-job checklists.  \\n There are different ways you can form a checklist  \\n but for this discussion,  \\n we'll look at yes/no checklists,  \\n meaning the person you're testing  \\n either performed the task or they didn't.  \\n So, how do you create one?  \\n Well, the first thing is to consult  \\n with at least two subject matter experts,  \\n meaning people that do that actual job.  \\n That's really important.  \\n Have the subject matter experts  \\n break the main task you're testing for,  \\n say a customer service technician  \\n properly greeting a customer, into sub-tasks:  \\n smiling, introducing yourself as a representative  \\n of the company, and so on.  \\n Once the subject matter experts have agreed  \\n on the sub-tasks,  \\n you as the instructional designer  \\n have a number of decisions to make.  \\n How many sub-tasks will you place in the checklist?  \\n All of them or maybe just the core ones  \\n that make up the main task?  \\n Of course, shorter checklists are easier to administer.  \\n What's a passing score?  \\n Does the learner need to complete all of the tasks  \\n or can they miss a few?  \\n How will the checklists be administered?  \\n Paper and pen or perhaps access  \\n through the learning management system on a mobile device.  \\n How will students' performance on the checklist be tracked?  \\n On a spreadsheet of some kind?  \\n I know that's a lot to think about  \\n but if you have a clear understanding of the tasks  \\n and what'll work at your company,  \\n I'm confident that it won't take a ton of effort  \\n to create a quality checklist.  \\n On-the-job checklists  \\n are usually administered by supervisors.  \\n So after you determine what's on the checklist  \\n and how it will be administered,  \\n you'll need to gain the support of supervisors.  \\n Meet with them well before you plan  \\n to have the checklists administered.  \\n Tell the supervisors why you're doing what you're doing.  \\n Explain why their support is crucial.  \\n Tell them what they need to do to administer the checklist  \\n and whom to contact if they have questions.  \\n Follow up your meeting with written instructions.  \\n If you don't win over the supervisors,  \\n the ones who are doing the actual assessing,  \\n your checklists will fail.  \\n Either they'll be ignored  \\n or supervisors will just go through the motions  \\n and check yes, yes, yes all the way down.  \\n A student's performance on a checklist  \\n can have weighty consequences,  \\n so you'll need to have a plan for tracking.  \\n If you house the checklists in a learning management system,  \\n the tracking will be done for you.  \\n If you use printable checklists,  \\n you might have the supervisor take a picture  \\n of the checklist after it's been administered  \\n and upload it to an appropriate place.  \\n Checklists are a wonderful way  \\n to assess the real world skills you're teaching  \\n in your digital program.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2324134\",\"duration\":142,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Assess performance through simulations\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_04_03_XR30_simulations\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about best practices for building digital simulations and scenarios.

 \\n Reflecting on years of designing  \\n and teaching in various formats,  \\n research on cultural and neuro-diversities in learning,  \\n and then my own experience with dyslexia,  \\n four characteristics began to surface.  \\n When applied to learning design,  \\n these would recognize learners as individuals  \\n and offer them choice.  \\n I decided to call them pillars because they support  \\n and hold up the design structure of inclusive learning.  \\n I offer these pillars to experiment with  \\n and apply where they work,  \\n but in no way will they be applicable in all cases  \\n because of the relevance or limitations  \\n of the technology or platforms you are working with.  \\n As I go through each of the pillars, ask yourself,  \\n what pillars am I already integrating into my designs?  \\n Here's the magic.  \\n Many times you are already doing inclusive learning design.  \\n You just haven't thought about it  \\n in the context of accessibility or inclusion.  \\n So you are probably already ahead of the game.  \\n The first pillar, learning is personalized.  \\n This considers learning preference  \\n where learners choose their own adventure.  \\n The result, ownership of learning.  \\n The second pillar, learning is responsive,  \\n which focuses on motives.  \\n Adjustments are made by designers and facilitators  \\n to support motives, and as a result,  \\n learners feel seen and heard.  \\n The third pillar, learning is flexible,  \\n which articulates needs.  \\n Learners can adapt and customize learning  \\n to meet their own needs,  \\n whether it's based on the information they need to learn,  \\n or the accommodations they need to progress  \\n through the learning.  \\n This empowers them to control their own learning experience.  \\n The fourth pillar, learning is communal.  \\n This is about connection.  \\n Here, learning doesn't happen in a vacuum,  \\n but instead, a deeper connection is created  \\n with the learning community.  \\n Just like learners,  \\n each learning experience is unique.  \\n These pillars can be used  \\n in both online and in-person environments.  \\n However, there are some elements that might work better  \\n in the online space and others in person.  \\n Consider which of these pillars seem like a good fit  \\n before you invest too much time and effort  \\n into any one design approach.  \\n And from there, let them support you  \\n along your ILD journey.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4381275\",\"duration\":203,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Personalization of learning\",\"fileName\":\"2502703_en_US_03_02_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, explore ways to design for learners to choose their own learning adventure.\u200b The result of this offers ownership of individual learning.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":9948061,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - I might be dating myself here  \\n but remember these Choose Your Own Adventure books?

 \\n What would be easy to implement?  \\n What would you like to implement  \\n but might be a little more challenging?  \\n And then what is not applicable?  \\n First off, ask questions about preference  \\n in your pre-learning survey.  \\n This will help you gauge how your learners  \\n think they learn best,  \\n and it allows them to reflect on their preferences  \\n prior to starting an experience.  \\n Gathering information on preferences  \\n guides the next design element  \\n which is to provide learning content  \\n in multiple formats such as video, audio, written,  \\n and even practice methods.  \\n Learners have options in choosing the best way  \\n for them to engage with the information.  \\n This supports differently abled learners  \\n through the learning process  \\n as well as learners who simply want choice.  \\n Offer pacing options.  \\n This income in the form of video playback  \\n features on time testing  \\n or setting an assignment cadence.  \\n Regardless of the approach,  \\n make sure you let learners set their own pace  \\n and remind them of the options  \\n as they move through an experience.  \\n Consider scenario-based learning  \\n for active and choice-based engagement.  \\n Transforming your instruction into real life scenarios  \\n offers applicable skills, control of learning,  \\n and experience that is unique to each learner.  \\n Create opportunities for personal stories, thoughts,  \\n and expressions, to be heard through discussion boards,  \\n journal prompts, and direct communication  \\n with your learners.  \\n Welcome varying opinions and different perspectives.  \\n Finally, if your experience involves a learning path  \\n or curriculum, ensure learners understand  \\n its entirety and options they have to progress through it.  \\n It's important you don't lose your learners  \\n as they advance through instructions  \\n and they have navigation choices.  \\n As a facilitator, having awareness of learner preferences  \\n can greatly inform how you direct your sessions  \\n and allows you to highlight the options  \\n and the formats learners have.  \\n Make sure you are familiar with both  \\n your learner preferences and options  \\n so you can help guide their journeys.  \\n The key takeaway here is that in your design approach  \\n you are creating choice for your learners.  \\n Giving them the power of how they want to learn,  \\n makes learners understand the control they have  \\n and in turn gives them ownership over it.  \\n Just hope they don't get eaten  \\n by aliens during their own adventures.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4382243\",\"duration\":215,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Responsive learning development\",\"fileName\":\"2502703_en_US_03_03_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to identify adjustments made by the designer and facilitator to consider the learner's motivations.

 \\n How can you adapt the design to support them?  \\n Next, apply inclusive language by keeping it simple.  \\n Use inclusive pronouns and descriptors  \\n while avoiding cliches and ableist language.  \\n This ensures that you are not alienating any learners  \\n who are neurodiverse,  \\n speak a different language, physically disabled,  \\n or just appreciate a simple explanation.  \\n Also, another tip, slow down when talking.  \\n These are fast-moving times.  \\n Do your learner a favor  \\n and don't have them race along with you  \\n through an experience.  \\n Let them digest and process your instruction.  \\n Another effective way to build rapport and to be responsive  \\n is to provide timely feedback.  \\n If a participant reaches out to you  \\n and you don't respond for weeks,  \\n they're likely to feel like they're not important  \\n or question if you actually exist.  \\n Honor your learner's time  \\n by responding to them in a timely manner.  \\n In addition to providing feedback,  \\n communicate directly with your participants.  \\n Sending a quick note asking them  \\n if they have the support they need  \\n or responding to a discussion post  \\n can have a profound impact  \\n on how learners feel connected to you  \\n and the overall experience.  \\n Finally, as a designer, identify behaviors  \\n that the facilitator can demonstrate  \\n to build relationships with learners.  \\n This helps empower the facilitator  \\n to be more connected and responsive to their learners.  \\n If you are facilitating,  \\n have awareness of learner information and motives  \\n to apply to engagement and support.  \\n One note as a facilitator in synchronous settings  \\n with limited time,  \\n consider offering your information sessions or lectures  \\n in the form of a video  \\n accompanied by audio and transcripts.  \\n Doing so allows you to focus your time on coaching  \\n and working directly with your learners.  \\n This is known as flipped learning, and it allows you  \\n to dedicate the same amount of time to the learning  \\n while shifting how you are supporting your learners.  \\n You're laying the foundation  \\n for rich connections with direct engagement.  \\n This type of relationship building  \\n can deeply impact everyone's investment  \\n in the learning space.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4378272\",\"duration\":210,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Flexible instructional approaches\",\"fileName\":\"2502703_en_US_03_04_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, discover how learners can adapt and customize learning to meet their own needs through design choices.\u200b As a result, learners are empowered to control their own learning.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":11194553,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - The third pillar of ILD focuses on flexibility  \\n so learners can adapt learning to meet their own needs.  \\n By incorporating flexible design practices  \\n into the learning experience, you allow learners to navigate  \\n and control their own experience  \\n based on their proficiency in a topic and their needs.  \\n From one designer to another,  \\n here are some approaches to ensure flexibility.  \\n As we've done previously, and if it's helpful,  \\n ask yourself, what are you doing already?

role\\nof the learner differently and prescribe different\\ninstructional methods to develop assessments\\nand measure their success.\\nEarly in the 20th century, psychologists suggested\\nthat human behavior, like that of animals,\\ncould be explained in terms of conditioning\\nwithout reference to thoughts or feelings.\\n\\nBasically, learning happened as a reaction\\nto external stimuli.\\nTouch a hot stove and you learn not to touch it again.\\nWhen you see a stop sign, you apply pressure\\nto your brake pedal.\\nWhen someone sneezes, you say gesundheit.\\nBehaviorism says that learning is the mastering\\nof predictable behaviors.\\nTherefore, the right instruction design will teach\\ndemonstrable skills that can be measured by observations.\\nWe apply this theory, for example, when we teach employees,\\nif you see something wrong, speak up.\\n\\nEventually, behaviorism was challenged\\nby a new generation of psychologists\\nwho argued that learning is a cognitive phenomenon\\nwhich happens when a learner receives, stores,\\nand retrieves information.\\nCognitivism was built upon the principles of behaviorism\\nbut focused less on stimulating observable behaviors\\nand more on how external mental models could be transferred\\nto the learner's mind.\\nWe apply this theory when we want people\\nto learn an organized set of facts and figures,\\nfor example, the rules and regulations\\ncontained in an employee handbook.\\n\\nConstructivism took cognitivism one step further\\nby asserting that people actively construct knowledge\\nin their own minds through problem-solving,\\nexperiential learning, and social learning.\\nIn this theory, learners are at the center\\nof the learning process and learn\\nby activating their own prior knowledge\\nand personal experience and looking at new information\\ncontextually and relative to their social environments\\nand interactions.\\nIn this way, learning happens as new knowledge\\nand experiences are adapted and integrated\\nwith a learner's existing mental models.\\n\\nConstructivism and various constructivist theories,\\nsuch as social constructivism, situated learning,\\nand

 \\n Can you see that okay in the back of the room?  \\n Okay.  \\n So let me give you about maybe a minute or two  \\n at your tables to discuss these  \\n and see what answers you would give  \\n for each of these three scenarios.  \\n (indistinct chattering)  \\n What do you think?  \\n The scenario is a small department's  \\n having a hard time working together  \\n because two senior employees  \\n create an uncomfortable work environment.  \\n The request that I got was team building training.  \\n What do you think?  \\n Was there a consensus at your tables?  \\n Was there a debate?  \\n - To me, it seems like it might be more of a conflict  \\n resolution maybe between the two.  \\n And so to establish perhaps what could be going wrong?  \\n Is it just a project that they're working on  \\n that they're not doing well with?  \\n Or is it something with titles  \\n or responsibilities and workload?  \\n - You don't know, right?  \\n Just one sentence description.  \\n And so you all raise good points that the solutions  \\n can sometimes be more complicated than  \\n hey, we're going to send everybody to team building training.  \\n If we want to make things simple, let's go back  \\n to what gaps training can solve, and what it cannot solve.  \\n So we're going to ask ourselves,  \\n is this a gap in knowledge, skills, or ability?  \\n What do you think?  \\n - [Narrator] No. - [Student] We don't know.  \\n - We don't know.  \\n Some people are saying we don't know.  \\n And some people are saying no.  \\n Why do you say no?  \\n - I don't know.  \\n That's a tough one, that's tough.  \\n - But what jumps out at me?  \\n That's your gut reaction, right?  \\n It's not a gap in knowledge, skill and ability.  \\n - Yeah, because I feel like  \\n that's more of a personal thing that they're bringing  \\n this uncomfortable environment that  \\n you can learn it and learn how to  \\n cope and work with other people.  \\n But I think that's something more just internally.  \\n It's more home training  \\n than something that you should learn at the workplace.  \\n - It could be.  \\n Okay, here are the answers to the activity.  \\n Team building training would probably not solve the problem.  \\n The conflict was caused by two individual employees.  \\n So I suggested that the manager addressed those issues  \\n with the two people directly.  \\n How about the number two?  \\n Employees don't know how to use  \\n the organization's new computer system.  \\n There's some key words here.  \\n What do you think?  \\n Is there a gap in knowledge, skill, or ability here?  \\n We make that simple enough?  \\n Okay.  \\n Here there appears to be a clear gap in knowledge and skill  \\n since there's a new system,  \\n so training probably will solve the problem.  \\n How about this last one?  \\n Employees can't keep up  \\n with their workload due to a staffing shortage.  \\n I've gotten that request multiple times.  \\n Let's do time management training.  \\n What do you think?  \\n - You tell your manager I'm stressed out  \\n 'cause I have a lot of work.  \\n And then they say, time management training.  \\n Basically what you're telling them is we know  \\n that your current situation sucks  \\n but you just can't make the best of your situation.  \\n So let's put you through time management training.  \\n - Yeah.  \\n Other thoughts?  \\n - We talked about that it might be more of an issue  \\n with just redesigning the organization.  \\n So time management training might be a bandaid  \\n but it might not fix the actual problem.  \\n And then another perspective is that  \\n that might actually work, it just depends on the situation.  \\n But I feel like a lot of times organizations  \\n will think that they're so underwater with things,  \\n but if they just took a step back and took a deep breath  \\n and really understood what they were doing was really  \\n just not productive, that might help  \\n with time management training.  \\n But again, we really talked about that.  \\n It would probably be reorganizing moreso than training.  \\n - Now, the last one is tricky  \\n because we really don't know the reasons  \\n why employees can't keep up.  \\n I'd call this one a maybe,  \\n since we'll need to do some further investigation.  \\n You could save a lot of time and money  \\n if you take a moment to decide  \\n if training is the right solution.  \\n Keep in mind that training can only solve the problem  \\n if you're missing a KSA, knowledge, skill, or ability.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3068435\",\"duration\":296,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Handle a request for training\",\"fileName\":\"572890_en_US_01_02_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, discover a model to effectively handle requests for training.

You may want to pause the video  \\n and download the Handle a Training Request worksheet  \\n to do the activity before you continue.  \\n See how many of the five questions you can answer  \\n and note which questions you'll need to investigate.  \\n When you're ready, hit play,  \\n and we'll see how participants in the live class responded.  \\n - So the request is, if you've ever worked  \\n in the building industry,  \\n you often have a team of maintenance workers,  \\n and they do things like painting,  \\n light repairs, electrical, plumbing, etcetera.  \\n And when you need a bigger job,  \\n they're the ones who kind of coordinate the other contractors  \\n to come in and do the bigger work.  \\n So we've been asked  \\n to provide our organization's maintenance workers  \\n with some training on green building maintenance.  \\n And so the challenge is to walk  \\n through these five questions,  \\n find out what answers we know already,  \\n and is there some additional information  \\n that we'd want to investigate  \\n if someone had given us this training request.  \\n So I'm going to invite you to take just a few minutes  \\n at your tables and work with your groups  \\n to walk through these questions,  \\n figure out which ones you can answer now,  \\n and which ones you'd like some additional information  \\n to help you get to the heart of it.  \\n (papers rustling)  \\n - So it's important 'cause the grant will provide them  \\n with a place, but you just have to abide by the code  \\n that they want it to look like.  \\n So it's important 'cause acceptance of grant?  \\n - Yeah, they need to uphold the standard  \\n in order to keep the grant.  \\n - There's probably like most grants within a set of rules  \\n to adhere to like an inspection, validation.  \\n I think that's kind of like a starting point  \\n like what's written into the grant.  \\n - So by following those..  \\n - I mean they have it right there, in green standards.  \\n So it's being able to meet, thinking about those.  \\n - Resistance, you know, if the standards  \\n make it harder for them to do their jobs,  \\n that can be challenge  \\n - There can also be equipment issues.  \\n There may not have necessary equipment time.  \\n - Because if it's on the grant,  \\n maybe the time that they call, it takes to build it,  \\n is longer than the grant cycle.  \\n - There are also bureaucratic restrictions.  \\n - Exactly. Red type, whatever.  \\n - Everything stems off of the standards.  \\n So the standards are the primary.  \\n Once they know the standards, then they can assess it.  \\n They have the skill, and if they have necessary equipment,  \\n which will be the ability.  \\n So I think it all stems off of that.  \\n - This project is important  \\n because it helps our organization offer  \\n more affordable housing.  \\n And we'll be successful if we meet the requirements set  \\n out in the grant  \\n To do that, our maintenance team needs to follow the green  \\n maintenance standards identified in the grant.  \\n So we'll want to get that list and compare it  \\n to what the team is already doing.  \\n That will help us answer question number four.  \\n What other factors might influence performance?  \\n From there, we can ultimately decide  \\n what training is needed.  \\n We might find that the maintenance team needs a lot  \\n of training, a little training, or no training at all  \\n If they happen to be following all  \\n of these procedures already.  \\n By asking the right questions, you'll often find  \\n that your training programs become a whole lot simpler.  \\n This means you can design and deliver them faster  \\n for less money while getting better results.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3071480\",\"duration\":322,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Create an individual development plan\",\"fileName\":\"572890_en_US_01_03_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Use a worksheet to create a customized development plan for individual employees.

 \\n Will one of them work for Jane?  \\n Let's see what the live class thinks of these two choices.  \\n - I mean, everything is weighed by the budget.  \\n What is the budget assigned here?  \\n So we need to have, find that information out.  \\n What is, how much, is the class option, number two,  \\n is that a significant,  \\n is that cause problems in the budget of the department?  \\n - Assessing a little bit more on the needs,  \\n but so, it's mostly just recruiting.  \\n It may not be her skill set that she wants to continue  \\n within her own career.  \\n So I would say option one would be the best one.  \\n Just get her hands around it.  \\n 'Cause she might not be there forever,  \\n if she's not really interested in that.  \\n I would rather spend, you know, $2,000  \\n on somebody that does want to do recruiting  \\n in those areas, than spend it on somebody  \\n that's not going on that trajectory  \\n with their career and their plan.  \\n - But if she were interested in it,  \\n and also seemed invested in the company,  \\n and staying with that company-  \\n - 100%.  \\n - Then, I think option two would-  \\n - Yeah, and that's where you define what her career plan is  \\n and what her career path is.  \\n And she didn't say it was really her thing, right?  \\n So.  \\n - [Woman] I think, yeah, we have to do more discovery.  \\n - Okay, we said we would give it just a minute.  \\n So I want to bring this back  \\n before we get two into the weeds, and see,  \\n was there any consensus at your tables?  \\n - [Woman] Our consensus is class number one.  \\n - Okay, and why is that?  \\n - We know she's interested in recruiting.  \\n We don't know if she's interested in anything else,  \\n and before we want to invest any other of our money  \\n in other skills, we want to see how she does  \\n with the recruiting aspect of HR.  \\n - Did anyone talk about knowledge, skills, abilities?  \\n - She needs the knowledge.  \\n - Are either one of these going to address the knowledge,  \\n skills and ability that Jane's lacking?  \\n - Yeah, it says skills.  \\n - [Teacher] How do you know?  \\n I don't know what her knowledge, skills, or abilities are.  \\n - We don't know yet.  \\n We need to, we're not ready to make, in other words,  \\n we're not ready to make decision.  \\n Okay, this was a bit of a trick question,  \\n because we haven't yet identified the specific knowledge,  \\n skills and abilities that Jane needs to develop.  \\n Let's take a look at what we want Jane to do,  \\n and compare it to what she's already doing.  \\n We can find Jane's gap by comparing what we want her to do,  \\n her goal performance, with what she's already doing now.  \\n Here we learn that Jane's gap is just three things.  \\n She needs to learn how to create recruiting strategies,  \\n conduct initial interviews,  \\n and assist hiring managers with making hiring decisions.  \\n One other factor to consider is Jane has experience  \\n conducting interviews from a previous job.  \\n If we can verify she has these skills already,  \\n we won't need to give her training on interviewing.  \\n Managers often jump to conclusions and send employees  \\n like Jane to workshops before assessing their skill gap.  \\n When we look at Jane's skill gap,  \\n we see that Jane probably doesn't need a lot of training  \\n to help us with recruiting.  \\n So what can we do?  \\n In this case, I'd probably have Jane work one on one  \\n with our existing recruiter,  \\n so she can learn these skills on the job.  \\n This would save us the time  \\n and expense of an offsite seminar,  \\n and get Jane up to speed as quickly as possible.  \\n Of course, there are other scenarios  \\n where a formal training program is a good solution,  \\n by using the individual development plan worksheet,  \\n you can help employees identify when that's the right choice  \\n and when another solution will be more effective.  \\n Keep in mind that the ultimate goal  \\n is to help the employee perform their new responsibilities  \\n as quickly and effectively as possible.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3068436\",\"duration\":353,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Develop learning objectives\",\"fileName\":\"572890_en_US_01_04_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to apply the A-B-C-D model to create learning objectives to focus your training design on necessary content while eliminating waste.

 \\n You can save yourself a lot of headaches  \\n if you answer this question  \\n before developing your training program.  \\n That way, you can focus your training  \\n on meeting those objectives  \\n and eliminate any other content that's not related.  \\n I like to use the A-B-C-D Model  \\n to develop learning objectives.  \\n A is the audience being trained.  \\n B is the behavior you want them to demonstrate.  \\n C is the conditions where the demonstration should occur.  \\n This might be an in-class exercise, a quiz,  \\n or even a task or assignment back on the job.  \\n D is the degree of accuracy learners need to exhibit  \\n to be fully trained.  \\n For instance, you might require them to pass a quiz  \\n by getting 80% or more of the answers correct.  \\n I challenged the live class  \\n to come up with an A-B-C-D learning objective  \\n for a training scenario.  \\n If you'd like to try it yourself,  \\n I invite you to download the auto-bill scenario  \\n from the exercise files.  \\n Push pause and try to create an A-B-C-D learning objective  \\n for this scenario.  \\n When you're ready, push play again  \\n and see what the live class came up with.  \\n And I've got a scenario for you.  \\n Basically, we've been asked to do some training  \\n for our customer service representatives on auto-billing.  \\n And if you're not familiar with auto-billing,  \\n I think most people are these days,  \\n what it is is if you sign up for a service of some kind,  \\n then instead of having to manually make a payment  \\n for that service, let's say on a monthly basis,  \\n it's automatically deducted from your credit card,  \\n debit card or perhaps checking account.  \\n And so, we're being asked to do this training  \\n as a response to customers who call in  \\n to and make a late payment.  \\n So one of the customer service initiatives  \\n is to offer that service to customers  \\n so that they're no longer late with their payments.  \\n It's kind of a win-win,  \\n We get paid.  \\n The customers don't have to incur late fees  \\n or the additional hassle of calling in  \\n because they forgot to make their payment.  \\n And our goal for this training program and the project  \\n is to get about 75% of these customers to sign up.  \\n So what I want to ask you to do,  \\n in your groups is take just a moment  \\n and see if you can write a learning objective  \\n for this training that fits the A-B-C-D Model.  \\n So the audience,  \\n the behavior you'd like to see them demonstrate,  \\n the conditions where we're going to test that,  \\n and the degree to which they need demonstrated accurately  \\n for us to say these folks have been trained in auto-billing.  \\n So let me give you a few minutes, here if you need me,  \\n otherwise, we'll come back in a couple  \\n and see what you come up with.  \\n (classroom chatting)  \\n - How about, how about,  \\n the, given a prompt,  \\n the customer service representative is given a prompt  \\n of a customer's issue with a late payment.  \\n They will be able to,  \\n to provide a feature that resolves that particular issue  \\n or given four different issues  \\n that a customer service representative will have,  \\n they will be able to find a feature  \\n that will resolve that customer's issue each and every time.  \\n So that we have the, the audience is the CSR,  \\n the behavior is they'll be able to provide a feature--  \\n - Accurately. - Accurately provide  \\n a feature. - Accurately offer,  \\n like describe the auto-billing to customers.  \\n - [Female Student] So if the, we think the behavior is--  \\n - So the behavior is what do you want people to do  \\n as a part of the training?  \\n What behavior do you need to see?  \\n To say okay,  \\n on all the late pay calls.  \\n - So offer it on all calls would be the behavior on the job.  \\n So how are we going to assess this?  \\n - In training? - Oh, how do we assess it  \\n in training? - Yeah.  \\n So it might, for example, it might be  \\n to make a, demonstrate an appropriate offer  \\n on a simulated call,  \\n or maybe we're going to observe five calls after training.  \\n We want to see this offered on each call.  \\n - Okay.  \\n - [Male Student] So that they just demonstrate it--  \\n - [Instructor] All right, what did you,  \\n Who's the audience for this one?  \\n - [Class] CSRs.  \\n - CSRs, okay.  \\n And what do you want our CSRs to do?  \\n - If I can have them explain  \\n that, hey we'll wave your late fee right now,  \\n or you won't experience late fees in the future,  \\n that is something that I could observe, measure,  \\n and specifically train to.  \\n - So what's the conditions?  \\n How are we going to test this?  \\n after the training?  \\n Are we going to have them do a in-class simulation?  \\n Something else we hadn't thought of?  \\n - The ideal scenario, if possible,  \\n since these people are already in-role,  \\n what would, in the training program have,  \\n give them practice in doing it with real customers.  \\n - So live calls?  \\n Okay.  \\n - Ideally, but if not,  \\n simulation would be the next best thing.  \\n - And, you bring up something which is critical,  \\n doing the actual work is almost always the ideal.  \\n So if I'm making these objectives,  \\n I could have something in class,  \\n but there's always going to be something  \\n that's kind of vaguely, not 100% authentic about it,  \\n but if they're going to write back  \\n and they're going to be doing the work,  \\n perfect opportunity to say my objective extends  \\n past the class portion,  \\n and maybe I'm going to listen to their next five calls.  \\n Is that fair?  \\n CSRs will make an auto-bill offer  \\n by explaining its benefits to five consecutive customers  \\n who are calling to make late payments.  \\n Now, it's your turn to apply this concept  \\n to one of your own training programs.  \\n I suggest you download  \\n the A-B-C-D Learning Objectives Worksheet.  \\n Use it to create a learning objective  \\n for a training program you are developing.  \\n You can also apply the model to an existing program  \\n that doesn't already have clear objectives.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3070456\",\"duration\":460,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Prepare employees for training\",\"fileName\":\"572890_en_US_01_05_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to create an action plan to get a group of employees ready to attend training.

 \\n For some reason, you just can't remember.  \\n Participating in training without a clear goal in mind  \\n is sort of like that experience.  \\n You're there, but you're not quite sure  \\n what you're looking for, so you walk back out of the room  \\n and a few seconds later,  \\n you remember you were looking for your keys.  \\n Now you go back in the room and instantly find them.  \\n Having a clear goal when you come to training  \\n is a lot like that second time.  \\n It's much easier to find something  \\n if you know what you're looking for.  \\n I'd like to show you a worksheet I use  \\n to ensure participants are prepared for training.  \\n It's called the workshop planner.  \\n Before we continue, I suggest you pause the video  \\n and download this worksheet from the exercise files.  \\n When you're ready, continue the video,  \\n and we'll walk through the worksheet together.  \\n Are you ready?  \\n In this example, we've been asked to deliver  \\n a presentation skills workshop to people  \\n who need to pitch projects internally to senior leaders.  \\n Our learning objective is for participants  \\n to deliver a presentation in class,  \\n that effectively demonstrates competency  \\n in content development, visual aids,  \\n speaking, and body language.  \\n The workshop planner helps us create an action plan  \\n to prepare participants for the training  \\n by looking at actions before, during and after the workshop.  \\n Before the workshop, we want to determine  \\n what the participants should do,  \\n what their supervisor should do to support this,  \\n and what the trainer needs to do to support the supervisor.  \\n During the workshop, we ask the same thing.  \\n What do participants need to do?  \\n What support do they need from the supervisor,  \\n and what should the trainer do?  \\n Finally, we look at what we expect participants to do  \\n after the workshop, and determine what support is needed  \\n from both the supervisor and the trainer.  \\n You can do this exercise for our sample  \\n presentation skills workshop  \\n by downloading the sample workshop plan.  \\n Pause the video to complete your plan,  \\n and then restart it to see the discussion  \\n from the live class.  \\n - The trainer needs to facilitate,  \\n facilitate materials that they said  \\n they were going to present on and make it engaging.  \\n - Yeah.  \\n - Now after the training,  \\n participant needs to be accountable  \\n and follow up on any action items,  \\n or apply. - Just apply, yeah.  \\n (people speaking over each other)  \\n Make it simple,  \\n apply to training. - Yeah.  \\n - 'Cause then if you're going to establish your training,  \\n what would be what do you want them to focus on  \\n in the training itself?  \\n - My participants?  \\n - Yeah.  \\n - I want them to focus on what they're training on.  \\n I mean the specific, the outline  \\n that they were given before they went to the...  \\n - So come to training in the training,  \\n - Like yeah.  \\n - Participate  \\n - Some way to reinforce what you just learned.  \\n - But I was going to say, I think supervisor needs to reinforce  \\n and apply like application.  \\n - So I want to bring it back together.  \\n I know I only gave you a couple of minutes to do this  \\n but you're doing a great job filling this out.  \\n I think a lot of you realize that  \\n this doesn't have to be complicated.  \\n We're just putting everything in one space  \\n of sharing with one of the groups.  \\n Every time I facilitate a workshop with a client of mine  \\n we do this as part of our planning process.  \\n It never takes more than an hour.  \\n So it's a very short discussion,  \\n but we have a very comprehensive action plan.  \\n In this case, we've kind of done a speed version  \\n of it if you will, but we've got a few basic actions  \\n you realize if we do these things much more successful  \\n with training and if we somehow forget to do these things,  \\n the training's not going to be as successful or as impactful.  \\n So let's just see if we can get just a couple of examples.  \\n The training itself, what do we expect?  \\n One thing we would expect from participants,  \\n going to this presentation skills training.  \\n - To be on the court being like pay attention  \\n - Participation. - Participation for...  \\n - Participation, right?  \\n Which seems pretty obvious, but I'll tell you  \\n that some participants can't wait to participate  \\n and other people, it's bad enough giving a presentation.  \\n It's really bad giving a presentation in a class  \\n where people in the back of the room going,  \\n \\\"Okay, well we're going to evaluate you  \\n and give you a score at the end  \\n and tell you how you're doing.\\\"  \\n For some people that's difficult.  \\n And so helping people work through that ahead of time,  \\n that this is a constructive process,  \\n is a good conversation to have.  \\n What would you expect, say from the supervisor?  \\n - To be supportive and check in with the employee show face,  \\n - [Trainer] Yeah.  \\n - The presentation.  \\n - Absolutely. Absolutely.  \\n And then obviously the trainer, right?  \\n This is usually the most obvious part  \\n of this whole worksheet.  \\n What would trainer be responsible for during the training?  \\n - Facilitate (chuckles)  \\n - To train the workshop, right?  \\n That's... (all laughs)  \\n Sometimes I'm tempted just to block out that box,  \\n but like all right, no, no.  \\n often there's something specific that comes up  \\n when we get to that box.  \\n You know it would be great if you gave an example on this  \\n or one of the specific challenges  \\n that our team has when they're presenting senior executives,  \\n is not getting to the point.  \\n Can you do an exercise around getting to the point  \\n and putting that more  \\n in the beginning of the of the presentation?  \\n So maybe there's something specific  \\n that they ask of you as a trainer.  \\n - Adding corporate culture or their company culture-  \\n - Absolutely. - Concepts.  \\n - Yeah.  \\n So that might and hopefully it comes up ahead of time  \\n but if not, this is another safety valve, if you will,  \\n for those types of things to come up.  \\n What about after the training?  \\n We often think about,  \\n \\\"Hey everybody, thanks for being here,  \\n and the training's over.\\\"  \\n But the training's really not over  \\n until we've accomplished our learning objectives.  \\n So what would do we want to see from our participants  \\n after this presentation skills training?  \\n - [Trainee 1] Apply their learning.  \\n - [Trainer] Apply their learning?  \\n How would they apply it?  \\n - [Trainee 1] Well, the supervisor might need to give them  \\n different opportunities for that training piece  \\n that they had and what exactly is the content  \\n and how they work through that in this situation.  \\n - Absolutely.  \\n And then maybe there's even an upcoming opportunity  \\n where they're going to give a real presentation, right?  \\n So think about that transformation for just a moment.  \\n Typical training, generic presentation skills class,  \\n \\\"Yay and was fun.\\\"  \\n With this model we're saying,  \\n identify a presentation you've got to give.  \\n Come to the workshop, being prepared  \\n and open to improving your skills.  \\n And immediately after the workshop,  \\n we're going to have you deliver a presentation  \\n using the skills you've just learned.  \\n And the supervisor who's very supportive is going to be there  \\n to help coach you through additional development.  \\n Very different learning model, right?  \\n One is kind of generic and I hope it works.  \\n And the other is very performance-based.  \\n We're moving someone along to,  \\n we hope giving much more effective presentations.  \\n So what do we need from the supervisor  \\n and I think you answered it, which is being supportive,  \\n encouraging that, but also being that person  \\n to coach additional learning, et cetera.  \\n Now often as the trainer, we're like,  \\n \\\"Hey, class is over see you later.\\\"  \\n Is there anything we can expect  \\n from the trainer after the training?  \\n - Follow up. - Follow up. Oh! sure.  \\n - [Trainee 1] Asking. 'em how the presentation went.  \\n - Touching base, following up.  \\n - Maybe says some action items.  \\n - Yeah. It doesn't have to end at the formal class.  \\n Maybe there's a follow up coaching session where maybe it's,  \\n \\\"Send me your PowerPoint deck for your next presentation.\\\"  \\n We'll take a look at it and I'll review it,  \\n send you some notes on the way back.  \\n There's many different options  \\n that you can think of as a trainer  \\n to extend that learning into the realm of performance.  \\n I like to use the workshop planner.  \\n Whenever I'm facilitating a workshop.  \\n It helps participants be more prepared.  \\n It helps their supervisors better support the training.  \\n And it helps me do a better job as a trainer.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

Because all of you have  \\n a piece of paper in front of you  \\n where the objective is written out on it, right?  \\n (group laughs)  \\n That should have been the,  \\n and what we're saying is  \\n when you do the training,  \\n go ahead and share that with the people you're training.  \\n This is what we're trying to do.  \\n The rationale is why we're trying to do it,  \\n and now let's do it.  \\n Did you do it right?  \\n Okay, here's some feedback.  \\n I don't want you to feel bad.  \\n What I want you to do is draw from this experience,  \\n because this is how trainers often get themselves  \\n into a bit of trouble,  \\n with limited time and resources.  \\n We get so stuck focusing on everything  \\n but the core of what we should be focusing on.  \\n First, it's the objective.  \\n Then it's how do we accomplish this?  \\n The best advice I can give you  \\n for designing training is to keep it simple.  \\n It's a good training program  \\n if your design will achieve the learning objectives  \\n on time and on budget.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3066436\",\"duration\":273,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Develop a training program\",\"fileName\":\"572890_en_US_02_04_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to develop instructional materials for a training program such as facilitator guides, visuals, and participant handouts.

I always,  \\n when I do presentations and stuff, I always tell stories.  \\n So that's always like in general hits home.  \\n - [Man 3] Understanding how learners receive information  \\n or use modalities...  \\n Will help trainers deliver the information effectively,  \\n and then provide a story.  \\n - [Woman 2] Yeah.  \\n - I want you to write down your goal.  \\n - All right, where are you now?  \\n - I want you to write... What do you know,  \\n what are your abilities, and what are your (indistinct)  \\n - So what is the difference  \\n between where you want to be and where you are now?  \\n What's your gap?  \\n - Yeah. - So this is how we create  \\n an individualized development plan.  \\n We want you to be able to do that with people,  \\n with all your employees, or your customers,  \\n or if you're a trainer, you're needing to train.  \\n - All right, your time is up.  \\n Were there any struggles  \\n that you experienced during the development phase?  \\n What were they?  \\n what we're developing ties in  \\n to teaching them the actual objective,  \\n and that we're not going off on a tangent,  \\n or going into the weeds, and coming up  \\n with just ideas on top of ideas  \\n that's not relevant to the objective.  \\n - [Man 4[ Adhering to time constraints.  \\n - Yes.  \\n - How many of you made at least one change  \\n to your design when you started developing?  \\n Almost all...  \\n So three out of the four groups?  \\n That's pretty common.  \\n What else did you find,  \\n maybe just a little bit of a challenge in this.  \\n So sticking to the objectives, what else?  \\n - Wrapping our head around collaboration.  \\n - Yeah.

I'm Josh.  \\n - Hi, Al.  \\n - Al. - I'm Dwight.  \\n - Dwight. Alright Al and Dwight.  \\n So earlier today,  \\n so we're going to do a quick recall activity, right?  \\n It's the end of the day.  \\n Let's make sure we know what we learned  \\n so that you can take it home and use it.  \\n So earlier today we talked about a recruiter, right?  \\n - Jane. - Yeah, Jane.  \\n The human resources coordinator  \\n who wants to become a recruiter.  \\n And we were talking about  \\n the types of things that training solves, right?  \\n In that time we talked about three categories  \\n of gaps that training addresses.  \\n So what I'd like both of you to do real quick,  \\n with these note cards,  \\n is write those three categories,  \\n and then we'll share them back with the group  \\n and see where we're at.  \\n And the cool part is  \\n Right? (people chattering)  \\n You guys can keep the cards, they're yours to keep.  \\n So if you don't mind me asking, Al,  \\n what was the first category you wrote down?  \\n - Knowledge. - Knowledge.  \\n And when we talked about knowledge,  \\n what do you think that includes?  \\n - Their current ability,  \\n to current information that,  \\n Jane's current information she's,  \\n her past experience or what she currently knows.  \\n - Perfect.  \\n All right.  \\n So Al, what did you have for another one of your categories?  \\n - [Al] Skills.  \\n - Skills.  \\n Who can remember what the third one was  \\n in those three categories that we talked about?  \\n And we talked about 'em very early on.  \\n (people chattering)  \\n You have the last one?  \\n - I was going to give him a chance.  \\n - Go ahead. - Go ahead.  \\n - Ability. - Ability, right.  \\n So we have the, the neat acronym, right, of KSAs.  \\n Kind of like KPIs,  \\n for those that know what key performance indicators mean.  \\n But yeah, so we have KSA.  \\n so we had knowledge which we can measure.  \\n And that's, you know, knowing like, you know,  \\n reading from a book or knowing how to use system skills,  \\n you know my ability or, you know, I can type really well.  \\n And then my actual abilities.  \\n And so we measure those three and through our analysis phase  \\n and find out, okay, are there gaps in those  \\n that we can address with our training, right?  \\n And if there are no gaps there,  \\n what does that maybe tell us?  \\n (people chattering)  \\n - No gaps, that there are no trainings needed.  \\n (laughing)  \\n - Right.  \\n So our objective today is for each of you  \\n to be able to recall the three  \\n primary learning modalities with 100% accuracy.  \\n Now I will use this Kush Ball  \\n as a example of these modalities.  \\n For example, when I tell you that this is a Kush Ball,  \\n I'm using the auditory modality.  \\n You hear through your ears, hopefully,  \\n that this is called a Kush Ball.  \\n I'm also showing you the Kush Ball.  \\n So I'm using the visual modalities to explain to you  \\n that this is a Kush Ball.  \\n Now, if I were to hand this to you  \\n and you can pass it around the table,  \\n now you are feeling what the Kush Ball is,  \\n or using what's called kinesthetic modality.  \\n So the three modalities are Kush Ball, auditory,  \\n visually, here's the Kush Ball.  \\n And then as you felt it, it's the kinesthetic.  \\n - [Man] What's the second category?  \\n - So those are the three primary modalities in learning,  \\n in learning. (woman sneezes)  \\n - Bless you.  \\n - For learning.  \\n Now I'd like you to tell me what modality would be used  \\n if I were to ask you to tell me what color this is.  \\n - Visual.  \\n - Perfect.  \\n And what color is this?  \\n - (indistinct)  \\n - Perfect.  \\n Now, if I were to give you these tissues,  \\n and if you could tell me,  \\n could you identify that  \\n without me telling you what it is?  \\n What modality would be used?  \\n (people chattering)  \\n - [Woman] Touch it.  \\n That would be...  \\n That would be kinesthetic.  \\n - Perfect. Perfect.  \\n And then if I tell you this is a piece of paper,  \\n I can just show it to you.  \\n It's a piece of paper that I'm holding.  \\n What modality are we using for that?  \\n - Auditory. - Perfect.  \\n And those are three modalities that  \\n are important to know as the trainer.  \\n - So as some of you could remember from earlier today,  \\n we talked about creating an individual development plan.  \\n So our goal today is to make sure  \\n that you can remember and recall the three steps of that.  \\n That doesn't necessarily mean  \\n that we want you to be able to recall it in order,  \\n but just however it is that you can remember how to do that.  \\n So part of our reasoning for that is, are you,  \\n what are you both working in right now?  \\n Are you trainers?  \\n Are you sales people, are you managers?  \\n - Sales. (laughing) - Sales, okay perfect.  \\n So from a sales perspective,  \\n what we're hoping that you get out of this  \\n is that you can relate to your customers on a deeper level.  \\n When they're looking for, you know,  \\n some training resources,  \\n you can really help them develop  \\n an individual training plan using our products.  \\n I'm pretending I work for your company.  \\n So just taking a step back,  \\n we want you to use your own perspective here.  \\n So say just in your regular job right now,  \\n what is a goal that you have for the end of the year?  \\n And we'd like you to write it down on this piece of paper.  \\n - To hit my number.  \\n - To hit your number. Perfect.  \\n So, so far we've identified,  \\n this is where we are, our current performance.  \\n This is where we want to be.  \\n And now we can kind of figure out the Delta,  \\n what is the gap?  \\n - So my answer to her question would be knowledge, skills,  \\n and abilities, right?  \\n - That'd be part of it.  \\n - I think it's just- - You said the three.  \\n to do the goal, and then your current,  \\n and then determine that gap from, you know-  \\n - Exactly. - That point.  \\n - It's even simpler.  \\n - Got you, okay.  \\n - You may have noticed  \\n that the best way to observe learning  \\n was when participants were given a chance  \\n to demonstrate what they know,  \\n whether it was a discussion, a quiz,  \\n or some other form of hands-on activity.  \\n That's an important lesson for any trainer.  \\n Any training we facilitate should have some opportunity  \\n for participants to demonstrate the knowledge, skills,  \\n and abilities we hope for them to acquire.  \\n This gives us a chance to observe their performance,  \\n verify learning has occurred,  \\n and provide feedback as appropriate.  \\n Now, I just showed you an example  \\n in a live classroom environment,  \\n but how would that look in a webinar?  \\n It's helpful to approach a webinar environment much the same  \\n as you would approach a classroom.  \\n You can quiz participants verbally  \\n or via the webinar's interactive features such as chat,  \\n or audience polling.  \\n Or you can even have participants complete assignments  \\n immediately after the webinar to demonstrate their learning.  \\n This is a great time to try implementing  \\n one of your own training programs.  \\n Remember training is only effective when learning occurs.  \\n So make sure you include interactive elements  \\n where participants can demonstrate they've achieved  \\n the learning objectives.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3070457\",\"duration\":283,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Evaluate a training program\",\"fileName\":\"572890_en_US_02_06_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"A training program is effective only when it remains within time, budget, and resource constraints.

Did everybody raise their hands for you, right?  \\n - Yes.  \\n - Yes.  \\n - I think it worked.  \\n I think the design was very effective.  \\n I think it was well delivered.  \\n I think the one thing we did do was have each  \\n of them do one piece, and each identified one piece.  \\n - Instead of having it all together.  \\n - Instead of having each one apply all three,  \\n so maybe just one at the end.  \\n 'Cause we did have a little extra time.  \\n We could have asked them, you know, can you write down  \\n the three modalities or something like that?  \\n And then, they would've known that that was it.  \\n - We could've taken some cards and done,  \\n have it like write a type of learning objective  \\n that is obvious to a certain modality and say,  \\n give each one of them and have them write  \\n what modality would be that students  \\n to get this objective cost.  \\n - Take it to a little bit higher level.  \\n - That still would be just getting them to one of the three.  \\n We wanted them to recall all three.  \\n - Yeah, have three cards for each.  \\n So, yeah. - I mean it's still improving.  \\n 'Cause one of the learners did not recall.  \\n - Okay.  \\n and something else.  \\n So you know, whether it's.  \\n Oh, I'm saying with extended time,  \\n you're able to do are better like, all right,  \\n let me throw in a different example  \\n that we talked about this,  \\n or let me find another way to approach  \\n and attack what it is we talked about.  \\n - More like we think?  \\n - The only thing I thought was,  \\n when I heard other folks talk, as they said,  \\n it's good to be brief.  \\n But then, maybe I thought maybe we could,  \\n if we had more time to develop the course,  \\n you would add other exercises to reinforce,  \\n even though it's very easy.  \\n I can't think of how else really to improve, you know?  \\n - [Male] Well, you improvise something.  \\n - I did at the last minute.  \\n So we had enough cards that I basically handed  \\n them three cards each so that I made them write down  \\n and then they would hold it up with their answers  \\n and say their answer.  \\n - [Male] Well, that's what he made me do,  \\n so we could it take home.  \\n - Yeah, so it was kind of hitting on three things there,  \\n they're writing, and they're reading it  \\n and they're doing it.  \\n - [Male] I like that.  \\n - So as the observer.  \\n - Yeah.  \\n - Did anything go different that could have gone better?  \\n - So the one thing I think could have been done better  \\n was from the beginning.  \\n At the end of the five minutes of this training,  \\n there are three things I want you to remember  \\n which is this, this and this.  \\n - [Female] Yeah, I did that a little bit  \\n too late in the game.  \\n - [Female] Yeah, and then I think there was one participant  \\n who was a little confused, but then we corrected it.  \\n And then, after he wrote the right answer.  \\n But I think it would've been good if he had  \\n a little bit more time and actually took the paper away  \\n and test him one more time.  \\n Like reconfirming, but it was done really well.  \\n She was really clear and she made it super relevant  \\n to each participant, like why it's important  \\n for them to know the individual development plan  \\n and how to create that, like why it's important  \\n for your specific role in your specific role.  \\n And it was really interactive.  \\n And so, I thought it was really well.  \\n Yeah.  \\n - It's good to do some sort of evaluation  \\n for every training program.  \\n It will help you create a better program.  \\n You might get ideas to improve  \\n the next training program you develop,  \\n and it helps you identify individual learners  \\n who may need some extra help.  \\n I found this step a great way to keep the training focused  \\n on achieving our objectives as efficiently  \\n and effectively as possible.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

The way you set up your classroom  \\n can have a big impact on learning.  \\n You want participants to be comfortable.  \\n They should be able to clearly see visuals  \\n such as flip charts and presentations,  \\n and the layout should allow for easy interaction.  \\n Let's look at a few steps to prepare for a classroom  \\n or webinar-based training class.  \\n I've created a downloadable training preparation  \\n checklist to help you.  \\n Here are a few highlights.  \\n The first consideration is visual technology.  \\n If your class includes a presentation,  \\n movie, or some other visual,  \\n you'll need to have a way to share it.  \\n For classroom training,  \\n make sure there's a projection system available.  \\n You'll also want to confirm  \\n whether there's an in-house computer  \\n or if you'll need to bring a laptop to the class.  \\n For webinars, be sure your presentation software  \\n is compatible with the webinar platform you're using.  \\n Be sure to consult the webinar user guide  \\n for any special formatting considerations  \\n such as the optimal screen resolution.  \\n It's a good idea to test out your visual technology  \\n before the day of the training  \\n to make sure everything is working correctly,  \\n and you have the right equipment.  \\n You don't want any surprises  \\n once the training starts.  \\n For classroom training,  \\n you'll also want to verify your other visual needs  \\n such as whether flip charts or whiteboards are available.  \\n Now, webinar software often has whiteboards,  \\n audience polling, and other interactive features  \\n built right in.  \\n Just be sure everything is set up and working correctly  \\n before the day of your class.  \\n The next consideration is audio technology.  \\n For classroom training  \\n be sure to set up speakers for any audio  \\n you plan to share such as music or the audio  \\n from a video clip.  \\n It's also a good idea to do a sound check  \\n ahead of time to determine if you'll need a microphone  \\n so your participants can hear you.  \\n For webinars, you'll need to decide whether to use  \\n the built-in audio or a separate telephone conference line  \\n for your webinar.  \\n Either way, do a dry run beforehand  \\n to make sure the audio sounds clear.  \\n For classroom training,  \\n the seating arrangement is another important consideration.  \\n For groups of 16 or more,  \\n my preference is pods or table rounds.  \\n This puts participants in small groups  \\n that are perfect for exercises and activities,  \\n while still making it easy for me and my visuals  \\n to be seen.  \\n For smaller groups,  \\n I like to arrange the seating in a U shape  \\n so everyone can be involved.  \\n Sometimes, the only training room available  \\n is set up a certain way  \\n and there's no easy way to change it.  \\n Now, the good news is you can usually find a way  \\n to adapt to the environment if you plan ahead.  \\n On the day of training, I like to arrive early  \\n to the classroom or log in early to the webinar.  \\n This provides plenty of time to get everything set up  \\n and allows a little extra time to correct  \\n any unforeseen issues.  \\n For example, I once walked in to a training room  \\n to see this setup.  \\n The pillar was obviously a huge problem,  \\n at least for the participants who had to sit behind it.  \\n Fortunately, I was there early enough  \\n that the seating could be rearranged and the problem solved  \\n before people arrived.  \\n Doing all this preparation  \\n can take some extra time, but it will help you ensure  \\n that your training program is a success.  \\n Any number of things can go wrong,  \\n from a technology failure to a poorly arranged room,  \\n but proper preparation can help you avoid these challenges.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3070458\",\"duration\":251,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Start your class with an icebreaker\",\"fileName\":\"572890_en_US_03_02_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, explore the use of icebreakers in a training program and learn how to use icebreakers effectively to save time and keep participants comfortable.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":16124435,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Chances are, nearly every training class you've attended  \\n has started with some sort of icebreaker.  \\n That's because they're helpful tools  \\n to make participants feel comfortable  \\n and encourage interaction.  \\n A really good icebreaker has three characteristics.  \\n The first is it connects the participant to the content.  \\n So if I'm doing a customer service class,  \\n that icebreaker should be something about customer service.  \\n The next is it should be appropriate in length.  \\n You don't want to take too much time breaking the ice,  \\n because that means less time for the rest of your workshop.  \\n I generally keep icebreakers to about five minutes  \\n for any class less than half a day.  \\n Finally, icebreakers should break the ice.  \\n The goal is to help participants feel comfortable.  \\n So the icebreaker should be simple and non-threatening.  \\n Let's take a look at an icebreaker I facilitated  \\n for a half-day train-the-trainer workshop.  \\n See if you can spot the attributes  \\n that make it an effective icebreaker.  \\n So you're probably wondering,  \\n if you've been to a training program before,  \\n you know, by law, we have to do an icebreaker.  \\n (attendees laugh)  \\n Well maybe not by law, right?  \\n But every training program you go to,  \\n you've got to do an icebreaker.  \\n So that's, we've reached that critical moment  \\n in the training workshop  \\n where we're going to do an icebreaker.  \\n I'd like to do something really, really simple,  \\n and that is, just at your tables.  \\n You could expand if you'd like.  \\n But I'd say let's keep things easier.  \\n At your tables, I'd like you to be able to answer  \\n three questions about each person.  \\n Your name.  \\n Because we've got some different organizations represented,  \\n maybe your organization and your role.  \\n And then training project refers to one opportunity  \\n to apply what you've learned in this workshop.  \\n So maybe you're working  \\n on developing a new training program,  \\n or maybe you're working on developing an employee,  \\n or maybe you're developing your skills as a trainer  \\n and there's something that's coming up  \\n in the next couple of weeks where you hopefully  \\n will be able to use what you've learned in this workshop.  \\n So kind of the answers to those three questions  \\n that we were just talking about.  \\n So that's what I'd like you to discuss.  \\n And because we don't want to take too much time,  \\n let's just take about five minutes.  \\n Have this conversation with the people at your table  \\n and then we'll bring it back to the workshop.  \\n - Would you like to start?  \\n - Ladies first  \\n - Okay. (laughs)  \\n - Hello, I'm Terrence.  \\n - [Josh] So my name's Josh, I'm...  \\n (indistinct chatter)  \\n - In California, I just moved to that role.  \\n So what I really want to focus on  \\n is doing a lot of clean up work with previous rep moving up  \\n and moving in and a lot of that's going to circle back to,  \\n because we never know what we're getting into  \\n and we're stepping into in people.  \\n - [Woman] Right.  \\n - [Woman 2] Hi, I'm Roxanne.  \\n - So this is helpful when I have the (indistinct) learning.  \\n And hopefully I'll be able to learn more.  \\n - I work for LA County.  \\n - [Man] No, so Sean...  \\n - [Woman 3] This is pretty good timing.  \\n (attendees laugh)  \\n - [Woman 4] Yeah, right?  \\n - [Man 2] Thanks Kevin.  \\n - Okay, what did you notice?  \\n First, the icebreaker connected to the content  \\n by asking participants to discuss  \\n how the workshop was relevant to them.  \\n Second, the icebreaker lasted just a few minutes,  \\n which is an appropriate amount of time  \\n for a half-day workshop.  \\n Finally, it broke the ice by encouraging participants  \\n to interact with each other in a low key way.  \\n These same characteristics apply to webinars too.  \\n For instance, if I'm doing a webinar on corporate budgeting,  \\n I might launch a poll to ask how many participants  \\n have prepared a budget before.  \\n Then I might break the ice a little more  \\n by starting a brief chat discussion  \\n around the benefits of having an accurate budget forecast.  \\n I want to make it easy for you to come up  \\n with terrific icebreakers for your next training class.  \\n So I've created a list of books and websites  \\n that have a wide selection of icebreakers for you to use.  \\n You can find it  \\n in the downloadable additional resources file.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3068437\",\"duration\":161,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Present with confidence and clarity\",\"fileName\":\"572890_en_US_03_03_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to engage participants by using different parts of the training room; interacting effectively with audio/visual equipment; and using impactful voice, tone, and body language.

(woman laughs)  \\n But sometimes on these, there's like five elements  \\n of quality and you hit four or five or whatever,  \\n or two out of three calls or whatever it is  \\n or on our, you could say on your next shift,  \\n after training, offer it on nine out of 10 calls  \\n as appropriate.  \\n (people chatting in background)  \\n So we demand excellence here.

(Suzanne laughs)  \\n That's right.  \\n ahead of time and you don't put them on the table,  \\n then we might not all be on the same page.  \\n - Right.  \\n - So, that's really the reason for doing that.  \\n The afters a little bit more comp, not complicated  \\n but something that we don't always want to think about.  \\n Like what would you want someone to do after the training?  \\n Probably give that, give that presentation.  \\n - Give that presentation, yes.  \\n - Create some smart goals around it.  \\n Have the supervisor follow up on the smart goal.  \\n - Okay, what techniques did you spot?  \\n Here are a few that I used.  \\n It all starts with observation.  \\n You need to observe your participants doing activities  \\n to evaluate their learning.  \\n I asked a lot of questions to stimulate thinking.  \\n This helps create a constructive dialogue with participants.  \\n I also invited participation from multiple parts  \\n of the room.  \\n Throughout the class,  \\n I make sure each participant gets involved.  \\n Even if it's just in the small group activities.  \\n Finally, I was careful to praise participants  \\n when they demonstrated learning.  \\n While still being encouraging  \\n when they got something wrong.  \\n Notice I didn't use a lot of goofy props or games.  \\n If the content is relevant to participants,  \\n they'll truly want to learn it.  \\n As a facilitator, I'm always looking to help my participants  \\n achieve what I call the moment of triumph.  \\n That's when they overcome a challenging problem.  \\n The process may have been a little uncomfortable at first  \\n but now they feel great  \\n because they've learned something new.  \\n You can make your workshops a great place to learn.  \\n If you can help each participant find  \\n their moment of triumph too.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3068438\",\"duration\":195,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Manage breaks effectively\",\"fileName\":\"572890_en_US_03_05_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Getting participants to return on time from breaks is a challenge for nearly every trainer.

Is everybody good with that?  \\n You're like, \\\"finally!\\\"  \\n Okay, so we have to synchronize  \\n because I don't see a clock on the wall.  \\n It is, on my clock...  \\n Okay, big hand, little hand.  \\n On my watch, it's 10:34.  \\n I'd like us to come back at 10:49.  \\n So 15 minutes from now at 10:49, we're going to come back.  \\n And when we do, I'm going to share with you  \\n a very simple demonstration of why information  \\n needs to be used right away or we lose it.  \\n So we'll see you at 10:49. Enjoy your breaks.  \\n All right, welcome back from break, everybody.  \\n I appreciate you being on time.  \\n Did you spot the techniques?  \\n I announced a strange end time,  \\n I teased the content I was going to share  \\n right after the break, and I returned from break on time.  \\n Now you might be wondering  \\n how much break time should you give.  \\n On one hand, you want to give people enough time  \\n to use the facilities, refill a beverage,  \\n and relax just a little.  \\n On the other hand, you don't want to give people  \\n so much time that they get absorbed in a work issue  \\n and come back late.  \\n I've found that 10 to 15 minutes is about right  \\n for a break and around an hour is a good lunch break  \\n for all-day training classes.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3070459\",\"duration\":200,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Deliver training via webinar\",\"fileName\":\"572890_en_US_03_06_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn the best practices for creating a webinar program, or transitioning from a classroom setting to a webinar setting.

What else?  \\n - Knowing where the learner or the audience currently is,  \\n where they need to be, where they want to go,  \\n and then those skill gaps in-between.  \\n So I take that, on an action item,  \\n is just more discovery, asking more questions,  \\n never assume anything,  \\n and kind of a practical example of that,  \\n is when we do trainings with our community partners,  \\n through LinkedIn, the YMCA for our carpenter rear office,  \\n and they're like, \\\"Hey, Terrence,  \\n we want you to get this group of students  \\n and help them rock their LinkedIn profile.\\\"  \\n And you're like, cool, what do I need to do?  \\n And you're thinking about all this cool stuff  \\n that they need to add their profile,  \\n and then you walk in a room,  \\n and half of them don't have profiles.  \\n So you didn't even ask the question,  \\n does everybody even have a LinkedIn profile,  \\n while I have all these cool slides up here  \\n to tell you how to rock it,  \\n you don't even have one.  \\n So, it's never assuming. - Yeah!  \\n one more thing that's a big takeaway for you.  \\n - Speaking of off script,  \\n is dealing with a, how do I say,  \\n practice resource constraints.  \\n That is a biggie,  \\n being able to be so comfortable with the content  \\n that if something goes wrong,  \\n or something that's being pulled out from under you,  \\n you can still get and achieve those learning objectives.  \\n You know what corners you can shave off,  \\n what shortcuts you can take,  \\n and still achieve your goal.  \\n - Absolutely.  \\n You can create an action plan  \\n to implement what you learned from this course.  \\n There's a learning plan worksheet  \\n in the downloadable exercise files.  \\n If you've already used it to set some learning goals,  \\n take a moment to create an action plan now.  \\n If you haven't already developed learning goals,  \\n now is a great time to write down  \\n some of the most important concepts  \\n you'll learn in this course,  \\n and decide how you will apply them.  \\n I've also created a downloadable additional resources file  \\n that contains recommended books, websites,  \\n and other resources to help you continue your learning.  \\n That's perhaps the best advice I can give.  \\n If you want to be a good trainer, you must be an avid learner.  \\n Take time to implement what you learned in this course  \\n and explore new techniques to take your skills even further.  \\n The best trainers never stop learning themselves,  \\n so I hope this course is just one step in your journey  \\n to developing exceptional training skills.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Conclusion\",\"size\":17559571,\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentChapter:3071484\"},{\"duration\":0,\"entries\":[{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:669754\",\"duration\":109,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Welcome\",\"fileName\":\"572890_00_01_WL30_Welcome\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":21013463,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\"- If you're watching this video,\\nyou probably train employees or are interested\\nin a career in corporate training.\\nYou probably also have a few questions.\\nHow do I know what to train?\\nWhat's the best way to design and deliver training?\\nHow do I even get started?\\nHi, my name is Jeff Toister, and I'd like to help you\\nanswer all of those questions and more.\\nI'm a Certified Professional in Learning and Performance\\nwho has spent an entire career in corporate training.\\nI ran my first train the trainer workshop\\nover 20 years ago, and I continue to mentor\\nnew and aspiring trainers today.\\n\\nIn this course, I'm going to give you step by step\\ninstructions to quickly design\\nand deliver training programs that get results.\\nFirst, we'll cover how to identify employee training needs\\nand I'll show you how to determine what is\\nand what is not a training issue.\\nNext, we'll explore a proven model for quickly developing\\ntraining programs that are highly effective.\\nFinally, I'll share some of my favorite techniques\\nfor facilitating classroom training.\\nA lot of training is delivered remotely\\nvia webinar these days, so I'll also guide you\\nthrough adapting your content to webinar delivery.\\n\\nMany of the videos in this course feature a live\\ntrain the trainer workshop.\\nThis is a real class where I deliver the same content\\nI'm sharing with you.\\nShowing you this live class gives us two big advantages.\\nFirst, you'll get to see me demonstrate\\nclassroom facilitation techniques in a real setting.\\nSecond, I want you to observe the participants\\nas they do some of the hands-on exercises.\\nYou'll see their creative solutions\\nalong with some common challenges\\nthat all trainers will encounter.\\n\\nWe've got a lot to cover in this course,\\nso if you're ready, let's get started.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:669755\",\"duration\":88,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"What you should know\",\"fileName\":\"572890_00_02_MM30_Know\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"The primary audiences for this course include new and aspiring trainers, managers, and supervisors who develop employees, and anyone who wants to brush up on their employee training skills.

For example, might be to make a,\\ndemonstrate an appropriate offer on a simulated call.\\nOr maybe we're going to observe five calls after training,\\nand we want to see it offered on each call.\\n\\n- Okay.\\n- [Man] So they just demonstrate in a...\\n- Alright. Let's start with audience.\\nWho's the audience for this one? CSR's, okay.\\nAnd what do you want our CSR's to do?\\n- If I can have them explain that,\\nHey we will waive your late fee right now,\\nor you won't experience late fees in the future.\\nThat is something that I can observe, measure, and\\nspecifically train to.\\n- So what's the conditions?\\nHow are we going to test this?\\nAre we going to have them, are we going to listen\\nto calls after the training or are we going to have them\\ndo an in class simulation,\\nsomething else we hadn't thought of?\\n- The ideal scenario if possible,\\nsince these people are already in roll,\\nin the training program\\ngive them practice doing it with real customers.\\n\\n- So live calls?

 \\n The cool thing about digital learning is  \\n that it often takes place where a worker does their work,  \\n for instance, a newly hired service technician  \\n demonstrating on-the-job competency  \\n by knocking items off a checklist  \\n or perhaps a software engineer posting a technical question  \\n on the company's social site.  \\n In either case, the learning is baked into the work,  \\n and that makes it more relevant and more valuable.  \\n And finally, digital learning jives  \\n with the way everyone learns today.  \\n When you need to learn something, where do you go first?  \\n My hunch is Google or YouTube.  \\n And it's not just adults.  \\n My nine-year-old spends a good chunk  \\n of her day learning digitally,  \\n in particular, developing reading and math skills.  \\n There are many, many benefits  \\n for including aspects of digital learning,  \\n extended reach, reduced costs,  \\n incorporating learning into the workplace, and many others.  \\n Which resonate most with you  \\n and the needs of your organization?

 \\n Tip two: break participants into small groups.  \\n Small group discussions and activities are great.  \\n They're often more intimate,  \\n they create some variety  \\n and the students learn from each other.  \\n Most virtual learning platforms  \\n have this functionality built in.  \\n If the one you're using doesn't, create a workaround.  \\n Tip three: regularly check in with participants.  \\n You don't have the luxury of having everyone  \\n in the same room,  \\n so you're going to have to check in with students  \\n a bit more than normal.  \\n Call them by name,  \\n ask them to turn on their webcam when speaking,  \\n encourage them to respond verbally or through the chat.  \\n If you want to check in with all students  \\n to see how well they're understanding things,  \\n offer up a poll.  \\n Tip four: include additional resources  \\n that complement the session  \\n that learners can check out on their own.  \\n This might be material from LinkedIn Learning,  \\n online modules, blog posts from leaders in the field.  \\n This will give you stuff to talk about  \\n during your next session.  \\n And tip five: keep sessions on the shorter side.  \\n The longest you want to go is 90 minutes.  \\n It's way better to have multiple sessions per week  \\n than one long honking one.  \\n Keeping them shorter will also make recording  \\n and uploading the sessions easier.  \\n We've covered a decent amount of ground there,  \\n so let's sum up.  \\n Virtual instruction is effective  \\n when students need immediate feedback  \\n and the chance to collaborate.  \\n When you design them, remember to:  \\n create activities that encourage participation,  \\n check in with students often  \\n and keep sessions on the shorter side.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319270\",\"duration\":181,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Technical tips and tools: Virtual instructor-led training\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_03_03_XR30_technical\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5488768,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] We want to deliver  \\n high quality Virtual Training  \\n and we want to look and sound good while doing it.  \\n To achieve these worthwhile goals,  \\n there are a few technical things  \\n concerning how we present ourselves  \\n and the tools we use that we need to know.  \\n Let me start with a few tips  \\n that will allow us to present ourselves  \\n in the best professional light.  \\n My first suggestion is to invest in a quality microphone,  \\n and of course run your session from a quiet room.  \\n Good headset mics aren't expensive,  \\n and will yield far better quality  \\n than the mic on your computer.  \\n They are also better at filtering out background noise,  \\n which you always want to minimize.  \\n Position your webcam so that you're looking up slightly  \\n when you look into it.  \\n This angle simulates eye contact  \\n and is more flattering as you'll have  \\n fewer shadows on your face.  \\n Also, make sure your face is well lit.  \\n Natural soft light is best,  \\n say from a window across the room.  \\n If that's not an option,  \\n place a lamp in front of you so as to illuminate your face  \\n and remove unflattering shadows.  \\n It'll take a few practice recordings to get your sound,  \\n camera angle, and lighting just right.  \\n But I'm confident that you'll quickly  \\n achieve a professional setup.  \\n Okay, now let's turn to tools.  \\n It's hard to do quality work without quality tools.  \\n Some of the more popular conferencing tools  \\n like Zoom and Google Meet are easy to use,  \\n but they're really built for meetings rather than training.  \\n But I get it, sometimes you got to use  \\n what the company tells you to.  \\n If you must use a platform that doesn't offer much  \\n in the way of training functionality,  \\n you're at least going to want to  \\n quizzing and polling application.  \\n For quizzing, I recommend Kahoot.  \\n A game based quizzing application,  \\n which participants have a lot of fun with.  \\n And for polling your participants, I recommend Slido.  \\n Both are low to no cost apps.  \\n Now, if you want to master the virtual training format,  \\n you're going to need a platform built for training.  \\n The two platforms I recommend are GoToWebinar and Webex.  \\n Both companies have been in the training space a long time,  \\n have robust features, as well as solid customer service.  \\n Whatever virtual platform you use,  \\n get intimate with all its functionality.  \\n Can you break participants into chat rooms?  \\n Can you offer quizzes and polls on the fly?  \\n Get into the software and play around,  \\n look under every nook and cranny.  \\n Research how creative people are using the platform.  \\n As you can tell, there's a decent amount of technology  \\n involved in virtual instruction.  \\n But mastering it comes down to two basic things.  \\n Setting up your audio and webcam  \\n so you look and sound your best,  \\n and getting to know your platform tools really well.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2320929\",\"duration\":172,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Development tips: Elearning\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_03_04_XR30_development\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Explore best practices and commonly used tools for building traditional elearning.

 \\n By assessing what your students actually learn.  \\n So let's go over some of the ways you can measure  \\n what your learners have learned.  \\n Okay, most of us are teaching students how to do work tasks,  \\n so one obvious way to measure what students learn  \\n is to see how well they perform those tasks on the job.  \\n A checklist is a popular way to do this.  \\n Let's say you create a video  \\n that shows warehouse specialists how to do specific tasks  \\n with the forklift.  \\n To assess how well they do those tasks,  \\n You create a checklist of tasks  \\n and have a supervisor administer it in the warehouse.  \\n A second way we can gauge our students' knowledge  \\n is to have them perform work tasks in an environment  \\n that's pretty close to the real work environment.  \\n This is called a simulation.  \\n For example, a roleplay,  \\n say one based on a selling situation  \\n that's performed by knowledgeable, engaged players  \\n is pretty darn close to the real thing.  \\n A third way you gauge knowledge is through scenarios.  \\n When you create a scenario,  \\n you describe a real-life work situation through text,  \\n images, video, and then you ask your student  \\n what they should do given that situation.  \\n For example, in a management fundamentals course,  \\n the setup might be, Jenny,  \\n who has always been a solid performer on your team  \\n has been late to work four out of the last five days.  \\n How should you approach her about that issue?  \\n You see scenarios all the time in e-learning.  \\n Last, you can gauge your students' knowledge  \\n through traditional tests.  \\n Even though a test is far removed from the work environment,  \\n it's still an efficient and effective way  \\n to assess what students have learned.  \\n Alright, to just sum this up,  \\n there are four ways you can assess the learner's knowledge.  \\n You can assess it through on-the-job tasks.  \\n You can assess it in an environment  \\n that's pretty close to the real work environment,  \\n we call this a simulation.  \\n You can assess it in a scenario.  \\n And finally, you can assess it through a traditional test.  \\n If you'd like to learn more about assessment,  \\n I strongly recommend Sharon Schrock  \\n and William Coscarelli's book  \\n \\\"Criterion-Referenced Test Development.\\\"  \\n It certainly shaped my thinking on the subject.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319273\",\"duration\":178,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Assess performance through on-the-job checklists\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_04_02_XR30_checklists\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about best practices for building on-the-job checklists that allow you to assess workers' skills.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5450253,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] The best way to assess  \\n how well a student can perform  \\n the work task we're teaching them  \\n is to have them perform it on the job.  \\n This is commonly done through on-the-job checklists.  \\n There are different ways you can form a checklist  \\n but for this discussion,  \\n we'll look at yes/no checklists,  \\n meaning the person you're testing  \\n either performed the task or they didn't.  \\n So, how do you create one?  \\n Well, the first thing is to consult  \\n with at least two subject matter experts,  \\n meaning people that do that actual job.  \\n That's really important.  \\n Have the subject matter experts  \\n break the main task you're testing for,  \\n say a customer service technician  \\n properly greeting a customer, into sub-tasks:  \\n smiling, introducing yourself as a representative  \\n of the company, and so on.  \\n Once the subject matter experts have agreed  \\n on the sub-tasks,  \\n you as the instructional designer  \\n have a number of decisions to make.  \\n How many sub-tasks will you place in the checklist?  \\n All of them or maybe just the core ones  \\n that make up the main task?  \\n Of course, shorter checklists are easier to administer.  \\n What's a passing score?  \\n Does the learner need to complete all of the tasks  \\n or can they miss a few?  \\n How will the checklists be administered?  \\n Paper and pen or perhaps access  \\n through the learning management system on a mobile device.  \\n How will students' performance on the checklist be tracked?  \\n On a spreadsheet of some kind?  \\n I know that's a lot to think about  \\n but if you have a clear understanding of the tasks  \\n and what'll work at your company,  \\n I'm confident that it won't take a ton of effort  \\n to create a quality checklist.  \\n On-the-job checklists  \\n are usually administered by supervisors.  \\n So after you determine what's on the checklist  \\n and how it will be administered,  \\n you'll need to gain the support of supervisors.  \\n Meet with them well before you plan  \\n to have the checklists administered.  \\n Tell the supervisors why you're doing what you're doing.  \\n Explain why their support is crucial.  \\n Tell them what they need to do to administer the checklist  \\n and whom to contact if they have questions.  \\n Follow up your meeting with written instructions.  \\n If you don't win over the supervisors,  \\n the ones who are doing the actual assessing,  \\n your checklists will fail.  \\n Either they'll be ignored  \\n or supervisors will just go through the motions  \\n and check yes, yes, yes all the way down.  \\n A student's performance on a checklist  \\n can have weighty consequences,  \\n so you'll need to have a plan for tracking.  \\n If you house the checklists in a learning management system,  \\n the tracking will be done for you.  \\n If you use printable checklists,  \\n you might have the supervisor take a picture  \\n of the checklist after it's been administered  \\n and upload it to an appropriate place.  \\n Checklists are a wonderful way  \\n to assess the real world skills you're teaching  \\n in your digital program.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2324134\",\"duration\":142,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Assess performance through simulations\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_04_03_XR30_simulations\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about best practices for building digital simulations and scenarios.

A 2.5% sales increase is still pretty good.  \\n It works out to $150,000 per year for five stores.  \\n Good, right?  \\n Well, the chief financial officer might point out  \\n that we're using revenue for our calculation,  \\n not gross profit.  \\n Gross profit is revenue minus the cost of goods sold.  \\n Here's what happens when we use gross profit  \\n for our ROI calculation.  \\n Let's say the average gross profit  \\n at our retail stores is 35%.  \\n We can multiply this by our pilot revenue gain of $150,000  \\n to see a $52,500 annual gross profit gain.  \\n To calculate ROI,  \\n we subtract the $25,500 program cost from the $52,500 gain  \\n and then divide that number by the cost of the program.  \\n This yields 106% return on investment.  \\n Okay, all this math might make your head hurt a little,  \\n but it explains how executives and trainers  \\n often see things differently.  \\n A trainer might say,  \\n \\\"Hey, this new sales training program  \\n increased sales by $150,000.\\\"  \\n An executive might say,  \\n \\\"Well, according to my math, we only gained $27,000.\\\"  \\n Now, this was a pilot with five stores.  \\n Let's look at the projected ROI  \\n if we roll it out to all 100 stores in the chain.  \\n We'll take the $5,100 training cost per store  \\n and multiply that by 100 stores.  \\n Next, we'll multiply that $510,000 total cost  \\n by the 106% ROI to get an expected net gain of $540,600.  \\n Okay, now I know again, that's a lot of math,  \\n so I've put all the numbers for this example  \\n on the downloadable sample ROI calculation worksheet.  \\n You won't use the ROI model for every training program,  \\n but this example highlights a situation  \\n where it can be very helpful.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3072565\",\"duration\":191,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Brinkerhoff's Success Case Method\",\"fileName\":\"479801_en_US_01_03_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about the Success Case Method.

several decades,\\nthree major theories have become widely applied\\nto instruction design: behaviorism, cognitivism,\\nand constructivism.\\n\\nThese theories differ in their definition of learning,\\ntheir understanding of how learning happens,\\nthe factors that facilitate learning,\\nand how learning changes behavior and lifts performance.\\nAs a result, they each characterize the role\\nof the learner differently and prescribe different\\ninstructional methods to develop assessments\\nand measure their success.\\nEarly in the 20th century, psychologists suggested\\nthat human behavior, like that of animals,\\ncould be explained in terms of conditioning\\nwithout reference to thoughts or feelings.\\n\\nBasically, learning happened as a reaction\\nto external stimuli.\\nTouch a hot stove and you learn not to touch it again.\\nWhen you see a stop sign, you apply pressure\\nto your brake pedal.\\nWhen someone sneezes, you say gesundheit.\\nBehaviorism says that learning is the mastering\\nof predictable behaviors.\\nTherefore, the right instruction design will teach\\ndemonstrable skills that can be measured by observations.\\nWe apply this theory, for example, when we teach employees,\\nif you see something wrong, speak up.\\n\\nEventually, behaviorism was challenged\\nby a new generation of psychologists\\nwho argued that learning is a cognitive phenomenon\\nwhich happens when a learner receives, stores,\\nand retrieves information.\\nCognitivism was built upon the principles of behaviorism\\nbut focused less on stimulating observable behaviors\\nand more on how external mental models could be transferred\\nto the learner's mind.\\nWe apply this theory when we want people\\nto learn an organized set of facts and figures,\\nfor example, the rules and regulations\\ncontained in an employee handbook.\\n\\nConstructivism took cognitivism one step further\\nby asserting that people actively construct knowledge\\nin their own minds through problem-solving,\\nexperiential learning, and social learning.\\nIn this theory, learners are at the center\\nof the learning process and learn\\nby activating their own prior knowledge\\nand personal experience and looking at new information\\ncontextually and relative to their social environments\\nand interactions.\\nIn this way, learning happens as new knowledge\\nand experiences are adapted and integrated\\nwith a learner's existing mental models.\\n\\nConstructivism and various constructivist theories,\\nsuch as social constructivism, situated learning,\\nand connectivism, have become the foundation\\nfor a majority of instructional methods\\nsuch as problem-based learning, authentic instruction,\\nand computer-supported collaborative learning.\\nAt this point, you may be asking,\\nwhich is the best theory to apply\\nto my instruction design projects?\\nThe answer is, it depends.\\nLearning is a complex process that takes place over time,\\nand takes places differently\\ndepending on the learner's prior knowledge,\\nmotivation to learn, and his or her subsequent application\\nof the learning to tasks in the real world.\\n\\nAnalyzing these

[Instructor] Okay, so you're tasked\\nwith building an elearning course.\\nHow do you get started and what do you do first?\\nElearning can be used as a stand alone,\\nonline learning experience such

modern day,\\nelearning is pretty much a standard\\nfor any organized learning experience.\\nThe reality we face as instruction designers,\\neducational producers, learning experience managers,\\nwhatever you want to call us,\\nis that many collaborators on a project,\\nthere's stake holders, subject matter experts,\\nand decision makers, generally don't understand\\nwhat an instructional designer does\\nor the complicated nature of an elearning production,\\nand rightfully so.\\n\\nThat's not their role.\\nBut it's up to us to inform them what's involved,\\nhow long it will take, how much it will cost,\\nand the details of the learning experience.\\nAnd a key part of that is the elearning storyboard.\\nI love storyboarding.\\nI love how you get a script and you pull it apart,\\nthink through the visuals that might show on screen\\nor the activities and the experience\\nthe learners might have.\\nBut the reality is, storyboarding is simply\\na communication tool, it's as simple as that.\\n\\nIt will define how the content will be presented\\nand how the learners will engage with it.\\nTo better understand storyboarding\\nin the context of elearning design,\\nlet's first discuss where storyboarding came from.\\nLet's go back in time for a second.\\nHistorically, storyboarding is defined\\nas a series of drawings or pictures\\nthat show the changes of a scene and action\\nof a movie or television show.\\nStoryboards originated in the motion picture industry\\nto help directors and cinematographers\\npre-visualize a film's scenes and sequence.\\n\\nWe think the first known use of storyboards\\nappeared in silent films in the early 1900s.\\nHowever, Christopher Finch in the Art of Walt Disney\\ncredits Disney animator Webb Smith\\nwith being the first to arrange a series of drawings\\nin sequence to tell a story,\\nthus creating the first storyboard as we know it today.\\nIn elearning development however, a storyboard looks\\na bit less like a cartoon panel\\nand more like a series of columns and rows\\nrepresenting the text, visuals, and actions\\nof a learning experience.\\n\\nIt's your key to establishing a course's narrative flow,\\ndefining the what, where, how, and why.\\nIn elearning design, we want to strive to show\\nmore than we tell, and a storyboard will define\\nwhat you will say and show on screen.\\nIt should outline specific visual elements\\nor any associated text.\\nA storyboard will also help you define\\nwhere the user will go next in every screen of the course.\\n\\nIt'll help you think through your branching logic.\\nYou need to be thinking at all times,\\nwhat is going to lead where and why?\\nAnd that why is so very important.\\nWhy should I show this on screen before that?\\nWhy do I want the text to appear this way versus that?\\nIn your storyboard design and development,\\nalways think beyond the how to the why.\\nThink of an elearning storyboard as a roadmap\\nthat guides all involved through each aspect\\nof an elearning course design.\\nIt's truly an essential document\\nin an instructional designer's toolkit\\nbecause it outlines what a graphic designer\\nwill create, what a narrator will say,\\nand the interactions the programmer will produce.\\n\\nThey're essential in giving form to your elearning vision.\\nRemember, storyboarding is a communication tool\\nto keep everyone in the project on the same page\\nand help yourself and your project team\\nunderstand what you'll be showing,\\nwhere you're taking the learners, and why it's

so, once you have your course title,\\nthe first thing you'll need to know as you get the handoff\\nto your elearning project is, who's involved?\\nWho might be on your team and who needs\\nto get looped into the approval process?\\nIt's important to know the key players,\\nand this is where stakeholders and SMEs come into the mix.\\nYour stakeholders are usually the initiators\\non the elearning project, and they are usually\\nthe project members that you'll need to sell your ideas to\\nor gain approval from.\\n\\nThey often have the most to gain from your work,\\nso typically they would be in a manager level or above,\\nsuch as a sales manager or a learning\\nand development manager or director.\\nDepending on the company or size of the project,\\neven the COO or CEO can be a stakeholder.\\nSubject matter experts are your content experts.\\nIf you're creating a course on\\neffective management techniques, for instance,\\nthey'll be the manager or trainer\\nthat is a master of managing others.\\nThey will most likely send you the first draft script\\nof content to include in the course.\\n\\nThey'll be your continual guide regarding\\ncontent development, content flow,\\nand they'll provide feedback on\\nhow the content can best be presented\\nfor maximum learner retention and impact.\\nOftentimes, your subject matter expert\\nwill be facilitating approvals\\nand gaining alignment on content direction as well.\\nIt'll benefit you to ask your SMEs upfront,\\nhow can I assist you in making sure\\nwe make this course awesome,\\nor in other more professional words,\\nwe achieve our business and learning goals on this project?\\nClearly articulate your expectations\\nof their role early on in the project as well.\\n\\nSMEs aren't always experts in designing instruction\\nfor online delivery.\\nAs instructional designers, I always say,\\nyou do not need to be a content expert,\\nI think you need to be an expert in communicating content\\nto a learning experience.\\nAnd we can lean on our SMEs for specific content accuracy.\\nYou'll almost always be working to a deadline.\\nI like to start from that deadline date\\nand work backwards to set specific milestones\\nwith SMEs to make sure we achieve our content goals.\\nAt the beginning of a project,\\nspend some time with your stakeholders and SMEs.\\n\\nAsk them questions such as, why are we doing this project\\nin the first place?\\nWhat is the potential impact on the business?\\nAnd what is the potential impact\\nof not doing this elearning or training?\\nThese questions will helps you gain a better understanding\\nof the business needs of your elearning project,\\nand it'll also give you that high-level, 30,000-foot view.\\nBuilding trust is so very important\\nto having a solid working relationship\\nwith your SMEs and stakeholders.\\nCommunicate early and often.\\nThey will thank you for it when their employees are seeing\\npositive improvements as a result of your work.\\n\\nAnd get to know them on a personal level,\\nhave lunch with them, invite them out to dinner\\nor happy hour.\\nWe spend all of our time at work in business mode\\nand we often lose sight of the fact\\nthat businesses are made up of people,\\nand we're all human, we're yearning for connection\\nin some way or another.\\nYou know, ask them about their kids or their passions,\\nget to know them as people first.\\nThis will make working together more impactful\\nand meaningful.\\nOkay, list all of the people involved in the project here\\nand loop them into feedback regularly.\\nStakeholders and SMEs are crucial in the creation\\nof any elearning.\\n\\nMake sure to have a clear view of that big picture first,\\nalways be able to tie these to your target audience\\nand learning objectives and goals.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:803855\",\"duration\":189,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Identifying your target audience and course

out\\nthe beginning knowledge base of your learners.\\nIf you aren't sure, you might want to send out\\nsome kind of pre-assessment to gauge their base knowledge.\\nAlso, consider the experience

pain points.\\nThe best thing I found, is to just observe learners\\nin their active environment.\\nFor instance, if you're creating a course\\nfor a customer service call center,\\nyou need to go listen to at least a few calls\\nto understand their environment,\\nand some of the challenges they're facing.\\n\\nUnderstand that your learner\\nwill bring with them past experiences,\\naspirations

audience\\nis all about developing empathy for your learners.\\nOnce you can put yourself in the learner's shoes,\\nyou can then begin to design an impactful experience\\nwith them in mind.\\n\\nOkay, back to our course scenario here,\\nwe've identified our audience as senior-level managers\\nwith at least five years experience in the role.\\nThey have a basic working knowledge\\nof coaching best

[Instructor] Once you have a solid understanding\\nof the business needs, and your target audience,\\nyou'll then need to translate them\\nto learning goals and performance objectives.\\nIt was the French writer and poet,\\nAntoine de Saint-Exupery that said,\\n\\\"A goal without a plan is just a wish.\\\"\\nSo goals are important, but what are they\\nand how do they differ from an objective?\\nThere are a few different ways\\nto think about goals and objectives,\\nbut here's how I see it.\\nA course goal indicates a broad learning outcome\\nstudents will acquire at the end of a course.\\n\\nSo imagine you're mapping a trip to a new location.\\nAnd the blue navigational line that appears on your Maps app\\nwould represent your goal.\\nSo your course goal indicates this big picture,\\nor that long-term view that gets one\\nfrom destination A to destination B.\\nThis will provide you with a clear direction\\nof where you're heading\\nand help you track progress along the way.\\nAll project goals should be specific,\\nrealistic, and attainable.\\nSo specific, the goal should target\\na specific area for improvement.\\n\\nRealistic, it should state\\nwhat can realistically be achieved\\ngiven the available resources.\\nAnd attainable, one actually has to be able\\nto achieve the goal given the parameters of the course.\\nThis should provide you with a clear direction\\nof where you're heading, and again, help you track progress.\\nOne approach to writing learning goals\\nis to frame them as responses to the phrase,\\nupon completion of this course, the target audience will.\\nSo for the purposes of our Coaching for Managers course,\\nthat could read, upon completion of this course,\\nthe learner will demonstrate effective coaching techniques.\\n\\nAnd unlike a goal, a course objective\\nindicates a specific learning outcome,\\nwhich is derived from the course goal,\\nand there are usually multiple course objectives.\\nSo back to the Maps example.\\nThe objectives will be the road markers or the highway exits\\nyou would pass along the way.\\nAll course learning objectives should be measurable,\\nwhich means you can track if the learner\\nreached the objective or not,\\nwhich makes it easy to observe\\nwhen a learner fails or succeeds.\\nAnd note that when all course objectives are met,\\ntheir corresponding goal should also be achieved.\\n\\nAn approach to writing learning objectives\\nis to frame them as responses to the phrase,\\nupon completion of this course\\nthe target audience will be able to.\\nSo back to our example, we could say,\\nupon completion of this course,\\nmanagers will be able to provide actionable feedback\\nto their teams across various steps\\nin the development process.\\nThat's specific, and something we can measure.\\nAnother tactic is to link the objective to performance.\\nSo think about what the learner\\nis actually going to be able to do\\nwith the skills and information once the course is done.\\n\\nSo you could say, identify opportunities\\nto coach teammates, and learn the steps\\nto providing actionable feedback.\\nAnd another way to think about this is to ask,\\nwhat's the desired outcome at the end of the e-learning?\\nI learned this from a colleague and never forgot it.\\nWhatever learning experience you're crafting,\\nthink through what do want people thinking,\\nfeeling, and doing differently\\nas a result of this experience.\\nThe mindset, the emotion, and the action.\\nSo why talk about goals and objectives\\nin a storyboarding course?\\nWell, because this should be your North Star.\\n\\nIt should guide all the decisions you make\\nregarding course development and design.\\nDefining the goals and objectives\\nwill guide the whole storyboarding process.\\nPrioritize your goals and objectives along the way,\\nto keep thinking through your learner's needs,\\nas you design your courses\\nand before you get started in on your

increased when information is shared with others.\\n\\nSo to make online learning sticky, one must feel\\nlike they're learning from a human being, an actual person\\nthey can relate to, not a bot

storyboard.\\nAnd I got such a varied response\\nfrom, I'm using pen and paper,\\nto, I storyboard directly in the application,\\nto, apps I've never heard of like Workflowy.\\nBut my personal opinion is it really doesn't matter\\nwhich tool you use to storyboard.\\nI usually use Google Slides, and Google Docs.\\nI'm sure many of you use PowerPoint or Word,\\nthese are totally fine, and I say use the tool\\nthat is most comfortable for you to get your ideas out.\\n\\nWith that said, when selecting a tool\\nto design your slides or develop your boards,\\nthink about if you will be working on a team,\\nor taking on the project solo.\\nThis can guide your decisions moving forward.\\nIf you're working on a team,\\nGoogle Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides\\nto me are a no-brainer.\\nAnd maybe I'm biased here because this is what I mainly use,\\nbut the advantage is they allow to gather\\nreal-time feedback within the documents\\nusing the comments feature.\\nAnd if you're working with other instructional designers\\non the same project, real-time collaboration is super easy.\\n\\nIf you're more comfortable using Keynote or PowerPoint,\\nWord, or Microsoft Excel, go for it.\\nBelieve it or not, we storyboard every live action\\ncourse here at LinkedIn Learning, and lynda.com in Excel.\\nThe advantage of PowerPoint though,\\nbesides the fact that it's a tool\\nyou might be used to using, is that you can upload\\nto articulate storyline with relative ease.\\nSo if that's your development tool of choice\\nthat would be a good call for you.\\nYou can export from Google Slides to PowerPoint,\\nbut some funky things happen to your text and graphics\\nsometimes when you do that.\\n\\nSo bake in time for some extra work\\nif you use Google Slides.\\nI actually find it really challenging to storyboard\\nin Microsoft Word or Excel.\\nI think storyboards should be visual in nature\\nand allow you to see the bigger picture narrative,\\nmove panels around as needed.\\nSo I just find it more difficult\\nto do this in those applications.\\nA final tool I'd like to call your attention to\\nis a relatively new tool from Adobe\\ncalled Adobe Captivate Draft.\\nI've tested this out and it's interesting.\\nIt has all the e-learning elements you'd need baked in,\\nsuch as content and question slides, branching logic,\\nand more, but the one caveat is that it's only for the iPad.\\n\\nAnd for you PC users, I don't think there's a PC option.\\nBut to me the main advantage I see here\\nis in rapid storyboarding, so I might try using this\\nmore in the future, we'll see.\\nI'm always looking for ways to be more efficient,\\nand collaborative.\\nWith Draft, all you need is an iPad and your ideas,\\nand you can dive in.\\nBut you also don't need to be an Adobe Captivate user\\nto create storyboards with Adobe Captive Draft.\\nSo this is something you might want to look into,\\nor try out.\\nA final thing to consider\\nis what tools are your clients used to?\\nWhen I first started freelancing, I didn't know Articulate\\nvery well at all, but my main client's internal team\\nused it so I learned it in short order.\\n\\nSome companies will use proprietary applications as well.\\nJust consider, how are your SMEs\\ngetting the documents to you,\\nwhat applications they're using\\nand then choose appropriately.\\nRemember your storyboard

[Narrator] There are many different versions\\nof storyboards, storyboard templates out there.\\nJust Google it and you'll get a plethora of information.\\nFirst, let's note that every storyboard\\nshould contain some or all of the following information.\\nText based storyboards focus mainly on, well, text.\\nAnd they will have text written descriptions\\nof each asset or visual you'll see onscreen\\nand the audio to learner will hear.\\nText based boards are usually about Microsoft Word\\nor Google Docs in a table format\\nlike this one you see here.\\n\\nYou can see we start with the lesson title\\nto let everyone know what content\\nthe storyboard aligns with.\\nThere will usually be space for\\nthe screen number you're on so also drop\\nand hear the type of screen this is\\nsuch as a quiz or an activity.\\nThis column will give your developer any graphics notes\\nso if these are your visual instructions\\ndetailing what exactly the learner\\nwill be seeing on screen from a graphic perspective.\\nThis next column will contain the text onscreen,\\naligned with that visual.\\nIn this final column in our text based storyboards\\nwill contain any narration or audio script\\nif your e-learning has voiceover.\\n\\nNow as an instructional designer,\\nI think you should always be thinking visually\\nso even if you decide to use this template\\nI'd recommend still dropping in a visual\\nin the graphics note section for your developer.\\nHave them pull images from Google\\nor I just mock up some pen and paper sketches\\nlike this for my developers.\\nAnything you can use to help them\\nunderstand what vision you're trying\\nto get across will help make the collaboration\\nand the handoff more successful.\\nSo visual storyboards are usually built\\nin PowerPoint or Keynote\\nand this may sound obvious but they will\\nalways show what the learner's going to see onscreen.\\n\\nAnd I find that visual based storyboards\\nend up being closer to the final result\\nthan working in a table in a Word document.\\nHere's a template that I often use\\nif you're wanting to show more than you're telling\\nin your storyboards.\\nAnd this template is great if you have\\nan image heavy palette or if you have simple\\nto complex interactions that you need\\nto communicate to your\\nsubject matter experts and developers.\\nSo let's define some of these elements a bit further\\nand take a look at how they might make their way\\ninto this template.\\nI usually drop the project title area\\nin a screen title area at the top of a panel.\\n\\nI find this keeps everyone reviewing the boards\\non the same page and it avoids my own confusion too\\nwhen I have multiple storyboards and projects\\ngoing on at the same time.\\nThe screen number area is where you'll add\\na unique identifier for each screen\\nsuch as two of 20 for instance.\\nThis main section here is your area\\nto define the graphics or the visuals you envision.\\nThis is the visual of what the learner\\nwill see onscreen such as\\nan illustration, diagram or even a video.\\nAnd you can add in images of hand drawn thumbnails here,\\nscreen grabs of Google images\\nor often you're probably designing the slides as well.\\n\\nYou can drop those in as mock ups\\nor your close to final slides here.\\nIn align with that visual section,\\nyou'll also have a descriptor here\\nin the visual info section\\nwhere you can note any text onscreen\\nthat will appear with the visual.\\nYou could also describe any animations you'd like\\nto see here or any media files to hand off.\\nAgain, such as a PNG, a PSD or an Illustrator file.\\nSo the voiceover and audio section is where\\nyou would define your voiceover narration\\nor audio script.\\nYou can also add the name of a music file\\nyou'd like to play over the visuals onscreen\\nor something that's always fun to think through\\nis adding any sound effects in\\nbut don't overdo it with the sound effects though\\nas it can up the cheese factor a bit.\\n\\nOkay in the top right section of this template,\\nthe navigation area is where you can describe\\nany interactions that occur onscreen\\nor define where the user will go next\\nwhich could include a video, quiz or a scenario.\\nInteractions, this is the good stuff\\nin e-learning design.\\nInteractivity has proven to have a significant impact\\non the effectiveness of the learning and e-learning process.\\nSo when you say something is interactive\\nyou're basically defining the dialogue\\nbetween the learner and the tool\\nfrom which the learner will engage in the process.\\n\\nAnd ultimately, learn something new.\\nSo you could use the Nav area to describe\\nany branching that may occur as well.\\nBranching differs a bit from interactions\\nas it refers to navigating the whole system.\\nSo to simplify this, just think of the next\\nand back buttons as well as any result\\nof a user interaction.\\nSo for example, if a learner fails a knowledge check,\\nor clicks on a link, this would define\\nwhere they are taken.\\nSo you can see in this example\\nwe're on slide one and next up would be slide two.\\nAnd then the user would advance the screen.\\n\\nYou can drop that section in here if you'd like.\\nI think that looks pretty nice up there.\\nOkay, last but not least\\nwe have the space for any reviewer comments.\\nAs I mentioned, I asked my team\\nto just leave feedback via Google Comments\\non the slide.\\nBut if you're using PowerPoint or Keynote,\\nthis could be a great place to keep track\\nof all the comments and changes\\nthat need to be addressed.\\nSo I highly recommend you take these templates\\nand make them your own.\\nEvery project is going to be different\\nand I'm constantly taking templates\\nand adding new sections and tweaking them\\nto work for the needs of the project.\\nMost storyboards though will probably\\nhave a mix of both text and visual based storyboards\\nand my recommendation, just fully think through\\nyour project first with a pen and paper.\\n\\nJust get down and get to work, scratch it out.\\nThis will allow you to be kind of swift\\nand try new things and fail often\\nand that way you can learn from what's working\\nand what's not working.\\nThen pull in whatever template you're most\\ncomfortable using and continue refining\\nyour ideas there.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

[Instructor] A key part of the storyboarding process\\nis the slide design.\\nAs you're thinking through your designs remember,\\nthe design should appeal to the target audience\\nthe instruction is trying to reach.\\nRecently, I was creating a course for high level managers\\nat a large organization and we used these illustrations\\nthat were fun, but they were somewhat elementary\\nin their character design.\\nAnd the feedback on our first round\\nwas that the graphics felt childish, eurgh right?\\nI totally understood what they meant too,\\nand so we designed a few more modern,\\nprofessional looking slides to complement the course.\\n\\nTo avoid that, here's some simple\\nuniversal design principles to think about\\nwhen designing your slides\\nand thinking through your visuals.\\nHierarchy is a type of graphical system for organizing type\\nthat establishes an order, allowing the reader\\nto easily find what they're looking for\\nand navigate the content.\\nNotice the organization here in this slide design.\\nYou have the header at the top\\nsectioned off with a color box for contrast,\\nyou have a subhead in bold 24 point font.\\nAnd then another second level in 18 point,\\nand if you need to go another level down,\\nyou can use the bullet with 15 point.\\n\\nI do my best not to reach this third level bullet point\\nwith text based slides, but it's there if you need it.\\nThis is a clean and simple design and easy to read.\\nBut what if you needed more text on screen?\\nThis is a comparison slide of text\\nusing a two column layout.\\nNotice there's a potential here\\nto have a lot of text onscreen,\\nwhich you should generally try to avoid,\\nbut the fonts are sizes that would make you\\nneed to be concise with what you show.\\nThat's a systematized and purposeful, creative constraint.\\nOn a slide like this, keep your word count down\\nand support the text with narration whenever possible.\\n\\nAlong with hierarchy is color.\\nYou could spend a lifetime studying color theory,\\nit's so fascinating, but for our purposes\\nsimply think about using color to direct attention.\\nThis can help your elearning reduce boredom and passivity,\\nand improve attention, readability and comprehension.\\nSo take a look at this example\\nfor our coaching for managers scenario.\\nWhether it's art, design, or a slide,\\npeople will look at the brightest object on screen.\\nHere I like the layout, it has a balance to it\\nbut you can see nothing really stands out.\\n\\nAnd I think timely, actionable, and consistent\\nare the keywords here.\\nSo let's make that pop by turning the other words orange\\nwhich has been identified as a color\\nthat we could use in this palette.\\nAnd now take a minute to look at this screen.\\nThe eye is directed to those keywords\\nin a clean, simple format.\\nI like that, slightly less opaque\\nthan the orange on the main text.\\nAnd reduce the brightness of the white here on that text\\nto send it back a bit.\\nNow we have achieved a nice balance of hierarchy and color\\nto guide the learner's attention\\nfrom top left to bottom right,\\nwhich is how learners read in the west.\\n\\nLet's move on to a sub-note of color, which is contrast.\\nThink contrast at all times.\\nDark backgrounds require a light text,\\nand light backgrounds require dark text.\\nThis will create the optimal visual experience\\nfor your audience.\\nHere is an example of a slide using color, hierarchy,\\nand contrast to guide the learner's eye from the text\\nto a video or image that will support\\nthis section's learning goals.\\nAnother important part of instructional design\\nis the use and layout of your visual elements.\\n\\nSo how you design your screen tells your learners\\nwhere to look and what's most important.\\nRemember you want the information on screen\\nto support the learning objectives of the course.\\nLet's take a look at this example,\\nI've seen stuff like this on storyboards\\nand it's like, what is happening here?\\nThe screen is trying to show ambulance aids\\nthat they should stand behind a moving vehicle.\\nBut the visual hierarchy here is not doing that justice.\\nSometimes the client might ask you to shake things up a bit,\\nor change the colors, or add in new graphics,\\nrefrain from that, keep it simple.\\n\\nThat can actually have a negative impact\\non how learners process the information.\\nHere's how I would redesign this.\\nRemove the extraneous items, like the bullhorn.\\nChange the background from that bright yellow,\\nremember light objects on dark backgrounds for contrast.\\nResize the guy, so he's at a more normal size.\\nAlways be careful when showing\\nwhat not to do in your e-learnings.\\nThe reality is, people will only remember a small percentage\\nof what they see and hear in your course,\\nso show the positive example,\\nin case that's the only thing\\nthey remember 10 weeks from

to do is figure out\\nthe visual style we're going for here.\\nAnd so, one thing I'll do sometimes\\nis start with a template design\\nthat I think is going to work well.\\nThe Google Slides templates are free\\nand have actually gotten quite good these days.\\nSo, we can use it as a starting point here,\\nand then adapt it to the course instruction.\\n\\nThis works if you don't have a graphic palette\\nor a design system on hand, so usually, it's a good place\\nto kind of at least start thinking through your visuals.\\nI kind of like this template, Making Presentations\\nThat Stick, by Chip and Dan Heath.\\nAgain, we're just going to use this as a starting point.\\nOK, so now, we have a script and a visual idea going.\\nSo, let's figure out what template to use.\\nI really like this template.\\nI created this in Google Slides,\\nand it can be adapted to PowerPoint very easily.\\nA version of this template is where I start\\nmost of my projects because it allows\\nfor simple to complex design thinking.\\n\\nSo, I decided to break the script\\ninto intro and header slides.\\nSo, let's drop in our section title:\\nIntegrate coaching into your management practice.\\nAnd let's add the text on screen for the intro slide here.\\nI like to do this so there's no confusion from what's\\nin the script to what's getting translated into visuals.\\nOK, so now, let's add the header slide\\nin that I designed on the side here.\\nNotice we're keeping it simple,\\nand we have a Start button to guide people in.\\n\\nWe'll need some navigation information here\\nfor our developer, so let's add that in, as well.\\nWe could say once the user is ready,\\nthey'll click the Start button to begin.\\nThen could add click Start to advance to the next slide.\\nPretty simple.\\nThen, regarding the visual info and media,\\nthis is the starter slide.\\nSo, I'll just let the developer know\\nit was designed in Google Slides.\\nBut I'd like to have a little bit\\nof fun here, so I'm leaving this note:\\nLet's have a light, subtle highlight\\naround the Start button, fading in and out\\nat an even pace, calling learners to dive in.\\n\\nIt's important to note here that certain things\\nare necessary to learning objectives\\nand other things are more for visual engagement.\\nThis would be a nice to have.\\nOK, on to the next panel.\\nLet's copy and paste the script\\ninto the description section.\\nNow, let's go out and snag\\nthe introduction slide I designed.\\nI usually just take screen grabs\\nof the designs and paste them in here.\\nAnd as you can see, this design is clean,\\nit's modern, it clearly articulates the section,\\nduration, and key topics using\\ntypographic hierarchy, as well as color.\\n\\nYou'll see we have a study guide\\nto download out here, as well.\\nAnd then the navigation to begin the lesson\\nis nice and clear, with a slight drop shadow.\\nThere's a solid hierarchy of information\\nguiding the learner along.\\nAnd let's be clear on what text\\nto show on screen and add that in.\\nAnd notice that will differ from the script section.\\nThen, again, add the navigation info.\\nWe'll say click Begin Lesson\\nto start to advance to the next slide.\\nAnd clicking Download study guide will auto-download a PDF.\\n\\nAdd any visual or media information\\nthat would be good to note here;\\nfor instance, the location of the study guide, as well as,\\nagain, noting the design was created in Google Slides.\\nOK, there you have it, our first two panels\\nfor our course, Coaching for Managers, have been

up a notch here\\nand dive into storyboarding something a bit more complex,\\nlike an animation.\\nAdding in animations are a great way\\nto keep your learners engaged.\\nSo we create learning experiences for busy people.\\nThe fact is that the adult learners\\nviewing our courses usually are strapped for time,\\nbut they're also looking for something\\nto improve their skillset\\nor refresh their knowledge of a concept.\\n\\nAnd adding in animations and interactions to your eLearning\\nhas the ability of increasing knowledge transfer\\nin a fast-paced learning environment.\\nSo let's storyboard an animation.\\nWe're still building out our Coaching for Managers course,\\nand this is the script we were given\\nfrom our subject matter expert.\\nFor the purposes of this movie,\\nlet's say we do not have a visual look and feel\\nmapped out yet and we'll be able to use a voiceover.\\nSo okay, take a moment to review this content.\\nFeel free to pause the video if you have to.\\n\\nSo do you have ideas about how you would storyboard this?\\nWhat template would you use to communicate your vision?\\nAfter reading through the script,\\nI decided that this template was the best option\\nfor this type of content, based on the fact that for me,\\nit's the most versatile template.\\nAnd I had an idea while reading the script\\nto animate a timeline graphic here,\\nand I thought that this would be the best way to communicate\\nmy vision to the reviewers and the developer.\\nSo this is an image I sketched up on the back of a napkin\\nin a coffee shop.\\n\\nIn this situation, we haven't quite figured out\\nthe visual look and feel.\\nSo in the spirit of being agile and sharing early and often,\\nthis was the quickest way to get this mocked up\\nand out for review.\\nAnd I love drawing and thinking through ideas visually\\nwith the hand before I take it to the screen.\\nIt's just a fast and a fun way to get thoughts out on paper.\\nSo take a look at our template and add in a lesson title\\nand the screen title at the top here.\\nWe'll call this Screen number three out of 25,\\nand now let's add in the text to the boards here\\nin the Voiceover/Audio section.\\n\\nNotice that I needed to tweak this section size a bit\\nto fit all of that text, and that's okay.\\nYou will constantly be tweaking sections\\nto fit your descriptions.\\nOkay, now let's add in the image I mocked up\\nbased off of our back of the napkin sketch\\ninto the storyboard template.\\nSo I think this gets my idea across fine.\\nI'm thinking a timeline graphic again\\nthat will advance kind of along this dotted line\\nfrom left to right\\nas the voiceover reads through each section.\\nAlso, I like how the image fits into this template nicely.\\nThis template is really made for visuals\\nand it's sized appropriately.\\n\\nNow that our visuals are in there,\\nlet's add in the navigation information here.\\nSo let's say the slide advances by user\\nand the next slide equals SBI scenario.\\nSo this indicates the user will click to advance\\nand that the next slide is going to be a deeper dive\\non that second graphic and text,\\nthe situation behavior impact scenario.\\nIn the Visual Information, this is where I would describe\\nthe animation for the reviewer or developer.\\nIf there are specific graphics or visuals you have in mind,\\nalways drag them down and leave the location at the top\\nfor the developers.\\n\\nSo in this case, I would grab these icon images\\nalong the dotted line and drop them in their location\\nand add that note here.\\nFor the description, let's say\\nstart with the people speaking\\nin the top right and left corners.\\nHave the dotted line and associated graphics\\nand text dissolve on from left to right\\nwhen mentioned in the voiceover.\\nSo looking at the visual,\\nwe can start to kind of see this come together.\\nAnd if we wanted to add a bit of interactivity here,\\nwe could have additional information appear,\\nmaybe as the user hovers over each circle or graphic.\\n\\nNow let's add in the exact text on screen to appear.\\nThis is important in a case like this\\nbecause all the developer would see at this point\\nis my chicken-scratch handwriting and this hand-drawn image.\\nSo notice I had to bump this section up a bit\\nto account for all of this text,\\nbut hopefully this paints the picture\\nfor the developer enough.\\nI always struggle with how much or how little\\nto write in cases like this,\\nbut I think my rule of thumb here\\nis to be as concise but clear as possible.\\nYou don't want to write a book here, but if needed,\\nyou could leave additional notes\\nin the Speaker Notes section of PowerPoint\\nor Google Slides and I might write something like\\nSee Speaker Notes section for more information\\nhere at the bottom.\\n\\nOkay, this is one way to storyboard an animation.\\nTake a look back at that script\\nand see if any ideas pop in your head\\nabout how you'd think through this differently.\\nWhich template would you use?\\nWhat would you include in the storyboards?\\nAnd how do you communicate that to a developer\\nor your subject

some kind\\nof a decision, and once a decision has been made,\\nthey then receive some kind of feedback on their choice\\nto either confirm their knowledge\\nor deliver additional points on the topic.\\nSo, if they click on a answer,\\nthere should be a corresponding action\\nto give them some feedback\\nor develop their knowledge further.\\nWhen you're crafting your scenario, keep it realistic.\\n\\nMake it about real-world situations over theory.\\nThink about, what are the core skills\\nthat they want to develop?\\nWhat real-world challenges do learners face\\nin their actual working environments?\\nIn keeping with our project theme of coaching for managers,\\nthe idea for this scenario is a real-world conversation\\nbetween a manager and their employee.\\nSo, in our hypothetical situation here,\\nwe didn't get much feedback from our\\nsubject matter expert on this.\\nThey basically just said, \\\"It would be great\\n\\\"to have some kind of a scenario here around communicating\\n\\\"with their employees.\\\"\\nThis will often happen when you're working\\nwith a subject matter expert on content development.\\n\\nThey don't know exactly what to say or show,\\nbut they do know that they want some kind\\nof a scenario in the course,\\nso we had to kind of create this on our own.\\nSo, here's what I came up with in keeping\\nwith our approved palette design.\\nTake a minute to pause the video and read through this.\\nWe have lots of charcoal and orange in the design,\\nlots of contrast.\\nThe flow is top left to bottom right,\\nas is a typical flow for learners in the west,\\nand you'll notice a background image\\nas well as an icon to represent someone speaking.\\n\\nRemember, the brightest thing on-screen is\\nwhat you'll look at first,

theory here, this is about action and response.\\nThis would effectively simulate a real encounter,\\nand the responses are probably responses\\nyou've heard before.\\nSo, that's our slide design and our text,\\nlet's head over to our storyboards.\\n\\nYou'll notice the lesson title,\\nscreen title, and the number at the top\\nto let everyone know on the project\\nwhere this fits into the mix.\\nAnd I usually just screen grab my slides\\nand drop them into the boards like this.\\nOkay, that's looking pretty good.\\nThere's no voiceover or audio in this section,\\nso we can put N/A here for not applicable.\\nIn the visual info and media section,\\nI'll add the location of the background image\\nin case my developer needs this.\\nI'll also note that this was designed in Google Slides.\\nA lot of times organizations will have an internal\\ngraphic palette to choose from,\\nso I'll add the description of the icon that was used here.\\n\\nWe're introducing some branching information\\nin a new panel on the right here,\\nunder the navigation information.\\nThis tells the developer, if the user chooses\\nthe first answer, they'll go to slide seven.\\nIf they choose the second answer,\\nthey'll go to slide eight.\\nThese are the feedback slides,\\nand it also notes how the slide advances.\\nSo, in this case, the user clicks their answer,\\nradial plus submit.\\nThe final thing to note here is a section\\nfor reviewer comments at the bottom right.\\nI'll often add this section in on a screen\\nwhere there's a bit more happening\\nto let the reviewers know some kind of approval is needed,\\nand I'll often ask a subject matter expert\\nor stakeholder to sign off with their initials\\nand a date in this section.\\n\\nIt's important to have a feedback loop in

answer.\\nYou'll notice a Go Back button,\\nwhich would then take them to the previous screen.\\nAnd this would be the design for the correct answer.\\nAnd again, let's give them some additional information here.\\nYou'll notice the advance arrow on the bottom right\\nof screen, this will take them to the next screen.\\nRemember to keep your scenarios real and authentic\\nand challenge

learner some additional and valuable information,\\nnot just sharing the correct answer.\\n\\nThink of time when you were taking a course\\nand you made a selection, and then you get the feedback\\nthat was like, that's incorrect, try again.\\nIt's kind of a bummer, right?\\nIt makes you feel like you're not getting it\\nor you're doing something wrong.\\nSo giving your learners here some additional content\\nwill just add educational value to the course,\\nand help your learners gain confidence.\\nSo here's the feedback we would add in for these answers.\\nTo keep this simple, let the learner know\\nif the option was correct or incorrect,\\nand then tell them why the option was correct or incorrect.\\n\\nIn our example, you can see the corresponding answers\\nthat would appear if the learner\\nchooses the correct answer or incorrect answers.\\nAs you can see, we're giving them more detail\\non each answer to deepen their knowledge of the topic.\\nSo you can create

specific parts of the course\\nor process you want to validate.\\nOr is it discovery?\\nAs in, you're in the project but you're a bit lost\\nand you need to realign your ideas\\nagainst the project goals.\\n\\nOr is it to facilitate collaboration?\\nSo if so, a project walk through might be appropriate here\\nwhere you can highlight specific sections of the course\\nand facilitate a brainstorming session.\\nComing to any stakeholder meeting with half-baked ideas\\nis just not acceptable.\\nBe prepared to tell a convincing story.\\nYou should be able to clearly and concisely\\ntell your course's narrative.\\nThen, explain how it addresses\\nthe course goals and objectives.\\nWhen you're preparing for the review meeting,\\nthink about what input do you need\\nto make the project more successful?\\nSo what are those elements that could potentially\\nunlock your roadblocks?\\nBe prepared to respond to any objectives\\nyou may be expecting.\\n\\nSo as you're going through your storyboards,\\ntake an empathetic approach\\nand think about your stakeholder's perspective\\nand their priorities.\\nSo what will they be thinking,\\nfeeling, and reacting to along the way?\\nTry to understand their motivations,\\ntheir interests, and their constraints.\\nSo what's driving them,\\nand what's potentially holding them back?\\nDuring the meeting, much like how you go about\\nbuilding a course, a good meeting presentation\\nbegins with the big picture, lay the context.\\n\\nAnd then, narrow it down into the specifics.\\nMake sure to get to the why,\\nso before diving into the how and the what,\\nshare your course learning goals and objectives,\\nand be ready to clearly communicate\\nhow this will not only fit into the course\\nbut also fit into the bigger picture,\\ncompany business goals and objectives.\\nBe clear and concise in your communication,\\nso they walk away understanding your ideas,\\nyour strategy, and you end up\\nwith approvals to move forward.\\nIf you can't communicate the ideas\\nbehind your storyboard designs concisely,\\nthen you probably haven't done the upfront work properly.\\n\\nIronically, it takes time and preparation\\nto be clear and concise.\\nAnd use active listening to understand,\\nrespond to, and articulate your stakeholder's point of view.\\nSome sentence starters you can use here are,\\nin other words, or if I can summarize your position.\\nThese types of phrases will validate all assumptions\\nand verify that you understand the feedback.\\nAlso, ask lots of follow up questions,\\nsuch as, what do you currently like and dislike\\nabout the storyboards, the designs, or the course?\\nWhat information is not included that should be included?\\nAnd you can say, do you feel like this

 \\n The cool thing about digital learning is  \\n that it often takes place where a worker does their work,  \\n for instance, a newly hired service technician  \\n demonstrating on-the-job competency  \\n by knocking items off a checklist  \\n or perhaps a software engineer posting a technical question  \\n on the company's social site.  \\n In either case, the learning is baked into the work,  \\n and that makes it more relevant and more valuable.  \\n And finally, digital learning jives  \\n with the way everyone learns today.  \\n When you need to learn something, where do you go first?  \\n My hunch is Google or YouTube.  \\n And it's not just adults.  \\n My nine-year-old spends a good chunk  \\n of her day learning digitally,  \\n in particular, developing reading and math skills.  \\n There are many, many benefits  \\n for including aspects of digital learning,  \\n extended reach, reduced costs,  \\n incorporating learning into the workplace, and many others.  \\n Which resonate most with you  \\n and the needs of your organization?

 \\n Tip two: break participants into small groups.  \\n Small group discussions and activities are great.  \\n They're often more intimate,  \\n they create some variety  \\n and the students learn from each other.  \\n Most virtual learning platforms  \\n have this functionality built in.  \\n If the one you're using doesn't, create a workaround.  \\n Tip three: regularly check in with participants.  \\n You don't have the luxury of having everyone  \\n in the same room,  \\n so you're going to have to check in with students  \\n a bit more than normal.  \\n Call them by name,  \\n ask them to turn on their webcam when speaking,  \\n encourage them to respond verbally or through the chat.  \\n If you want to check in with all students  \\n to see how well they're understanding things,  \\n offer up a poll.  \\n Tip four: include additional resources  \\n that complement the session  \\n that learners can check out on their own.  \\n This might be material from LinkedIn Learning,  \\n online modules, blog posts from leaders in the field.  \\n This will give you stuff to talk about  \\n during your next session.  \\n And tip five: keep sessions on the shorter side.  \\n The longest you want to go is 90 minutes.  \\n It's way better to have multiple sessions per week  \\n than one long honking one.  \\n Keeping them shorter will also make recording  \\n and uploading the sessions easier.  \\n We've covered a decent amount of ground there,  \\n so let's sum up.  \\n Virtual instruction is effective  \\n when students need immediate feedback  \\n and the chance to collaborate.  \\n When you design them, remember to:  \\n create activities that encourage participation,  \\n check in with students often  \\n and keep sessions on the shorter side.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319270\",\"duration\":181,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Technical tips and tools: Virtual instructor-led training\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_03_03_XR30_technical\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5488768,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] We want to deliver  \\n high quality Virtual Training  \\n and we want to look and sound good while doing it.  \\n To achieve these worthwhile goals,  \\n there are a few technical things  \\n concerning how we present ourselves  \\n and the tools we use that we need to know.  \\n Let me start with a few tips  \\n that will allow us to present ourselves  \\n in the best professional light.  \\n My first suggestion is to invest in a quality microphone,  \\n and of course run your session from a quiet room.  \\n Good headset mics aren't expensive,  \\n and will yield far better quality  \\n than the mic on your computer.  \\n They are also better at filtering out background noise,  \\n which you always want to minimize.  \\n Position your webcam so that you're looking up slightly  \\n when you look into it.  \\n This angle simulates eye contact  \\n and is more flattering as you'll have  \\n fewer shadows on your face.  \\n Also, make sure your face is well lit.  \\n Natural soft light is best,  \\n say from a window across the room.  \\n If that's not an option,  \\n place a lamp in front of you so as to illuminate your face  \\n and remove unflattering shadows.  \\n It'll take a few practice recordings to get your sound,  \\n camera angle, and lighting just right.  \\n But I'm confident that you'll quickly  \\n achieve a professional setup.  \\n Okay, now let's turn to tools.  \\n It's hard to do quality work without quality tools.  \\n Some of the more popular conferencing tools  \\n like Zoom and Google Meet are easy to use,  \\n but they're really built for meetings rather than training.  \\n But I get it, sometimes you got to use  \\n what the company tells you to.  \\n If you must use a platform that doesn't offer much  \\n in the way of training functionality,  \\n you're at least going to want to  \\n quizzing and polling application.  \\n For quizzing, I recommend Kahoot.  \\n A game based quizzing application,  \\n which participants have a lot of fun with.  \\n And for polling your participants, I recommend Slido.  \\n Both are low to no cost apps.  \\n Now, if you want to master the virtual training format,  \\n you're going to need a platform built for training.  \\n The two platforms I recommend are GoToWebinar and Webex.  \\n Both companies have been in the training space a long time,  \\n have robust features, as well as solid customer service.  \\n Whatever virtual platform you use,  \\n get intimate with all its functionality.  \\n Can you break participants into chat rooms?  \\n Can you offer quizzes and polls on the fly?  \\n Get into the software and play around,  \\n look under every nook and cranny.  \\n Research how creative people are using the platform.  \\n As you can tell, there's a decent amount of technology  \\n involved in virtual instruction.  \\n But mastering it comes down to two basic things.  \\n Setting up your audio and webcam  \\n so you look and sound your best,  \\n and getting to know your platform tools really well.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2320929\",\"duration\":172,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Development tips: Elearning\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_03_04_XR30_development\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Explore best practices and commonly used tools for building traditional elearning.

 \\n By assessing what your students actually learn.  \\n So let's go over some of the ways you can measure  \\n what your learners have learned.  \\n Okay, most of us are teaching students how to do work tasks,  \\n so one obvious way to measure what students learn  \\n is to see how well they perform those tasks on the job.  \\n A checklist is a popular way to do this.  \\n Let's say you create a video  \\n that shows warehouse specialists how to do specific tasks  \\n with the forklift.  \\n To assess how well they do those tasks,  \\n You create a checklist of tasks  \\n and have a supervisor administer it in the warehouse.  \\n A second way we can gauge our students' knowledge  \\n is to have them perform work tasks in an environment  \\n that's pretty close to the real work environment.  \\n This is called a simulation.  \\n For example, a roleplay,  \\n say one based on a selling situation  \\n that's performed by knowledgeable, engaged players  \\n is pretty darn close to the real thing.  \\n A third way you gauge knowledge is through scenarios.  \\n When you create a scenario,  \\n you describe a real-life work situation through text,  \\n images, video, and then you ask your student  \\n what they should do given that situation.  \\n For example, in a management fundamentals course,  \\n the setup might be, Jenny,  \\n who has always been a solid performer on your team  \\n has been late to work four out of the last five days.  \\n How should you approach her about that issue?  \\n You see scenarios all the time in e-learning.  \\n Last, you can gauge your students' knowledge  \\n through traditional tests.  \\n Even though a test is far removed from the work environment,  \\n it's still an efficient and effective way  \\n to assess what students have learned.  \\n Alright, to just sum this up,  \\n there are four ways you can assess the learner's knowledge.  \\n You can assess it through on-the-job tasks.  \\n You can assess it in an environment  \\n that's pretty close to the real work environment,  \\n we call this a simulation.  \\n You can assess it in a scenario.  \\n And finally, you can assess it through a traditional test.  \\n If you'd like to learn more about assessment,  \\n I strongly recommend Sharon Schrock  \\n and William Coscarelli's book  \\n \\\"Criterion-Referenced Test Development.\\\"  \\n It certainly shaped my thinking on the subject.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319273\",\"duration\":178,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Assess performance through on-the-job checklists\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_04_02_XR30_checklists\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about best practices for building on-the-job checklists that allow you to assess workers' skills.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5450253,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] The best way to assess  \\n how well a student can perform  \\n the work task we're teaching them  \\n is to have them perform it on the job.  \\n This is commonly done through on-the-job checklists.  \\n There are different ways you can form a checklist  \\n but for this discussion,  \\n we'll look at yes/no checklists,  \\n meaning the person you're testing  \\n either performed the task or they didn't.  \\n So, how do you create one?  \\n Well, the first thing is to consult  \\n with at least two subject matter experts,  \\n meaning people that do that actual job.  \\n That's really important.  \\n Have the subject matter experts  \\n break the main task you're testing for,  \\n say a customer service technician  \\n properly greeting a customer, into sub-tasks:  \\n smiling, introducing yourself as a representative  \\n of the company, and so on.  \\n Once the subject matter experts have agreed  \\n on the sub-tasks,  \\n you as the instructional designer  \\n have a number of decisions to make.  \\n How many sub-tasks will you place in the checklist?  \\n All of them or maybe just the core ones  \\n that make up the main task?  \\n Of course, shorter checklists are easier to administer.  \\n What's a passing score?  \\n Does the learner need to complete all of the tasks  \\n or can they miss a few?  \\n How will the checklists be administered?  \\n Paper and pen or perhaps access  \\n through the learning management system on a mobile device.  \\n How will students' performance on the checklist be tracked?  \\n On a spreadsheet of some kind?  \\n I know that's a lot to think about  \\n but if you have a clear understanding of the tasks  \\n and what'll work at your company,  \\n I'm confident that it won't take a ton of effort  \\n to create a quality checklist.  \\n On-the-job checklists  \\n are usually administered by supervisors.  \\n So after you determine what's on the checklist  \\n and how it will be administered,  \\n you'll need to gain the support of supervisors.  \\n Meet with them well before you plan  \\n to have the checklists administered.  \\n Tell the supervisors why you're doing what you're doing.  \\n Explain why their support is crucial.  \\n Tell them what they need to do to administer the checklist  \\n and whom to contact if they have questions.  \\n Follow up your meeting with written instructions.  \\n If you don't win over the supervisors,  \\n the ones who are doing the actual assessing,  \\n your checklists will fail.  \\n Either they'll be ignored  \\n or supervisors will just go through the motions  \\n and check yes, yes, yes all the way down.  \\n A student's performance on a checklist  \\n can have weighty consequences,  \\n so you'll need to have a plan for tracking.  \\n If you house the checklists in a learning management system,  \\n the tracking will be done for you.  \\n If you use printable checklists,  \\n you might have the supervisor take a picture  \\n of the checklist after it's been administered  \\n and upload it to an appropriate place.  \\n Checklists are a wonderful way  \\n to assess the real world skills you're teaching  \\n in your digital program.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2324134\",\"duration\":142,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Assess performance through simulations\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_04_03_XR30_simulations\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about best practices for building digital simulations and scenarios.

 \\n Fantastic, schedule regular one-on-ones,  \\n or hold virtual office hours.  \\n Or maybe it's creating small group activities  \\n that really gets your motor humming.  \\n Awesome, work 'em into a short weekly virtual session,  \\n or get students collaborating in a forum-type space,  \\n embrace technical glitches  \\n and adjust your timelines accordingly.  \\n I'm with you that it can be super frustrating  \\n when something is supposed to work but doesn't.  \\n If you're going to excel in digital blends though,  \\n you have to accept that technical glitches  \\n are just simply part of the game.  \\n Expect that they will happen  \\n and create some buffer in your timelines  \\n to deal with them.  \\n Mix up the way you present material.  \\n For me, this is one of the greatest strengths  \\n of digital learning.  \\n There are so many ways to get the information across.  \\n But if you're focusing on one aspect  \\n of digital learning for an extended time,  \\n say a longish virtual instructor-led course  \\n or a series of E-Learning modules,  \\n challenge yourself to find different ways  \\n to get the learner interacting with the content.  \\n Another tip is to modularize your content,  \\n which is a fancy way of saying  \\n break up your content into small chunks.  \\n There are so many good reasons for this.  \\n It's easier on you as a creator of content.  \\n It's better for your students who need frequent breaks  \\n to make sense of the material  \\n and not get overloaded with information.  \\n It also makes updating your learning program  \\n that much easier.  \\n And the last tip I have is to repeat the core ideas  \\n you want your learners to learn  \\n throughout the learning experience.  \\n Repeat the core ideas of the first virtual session  \\n in the second session.  \\n Repeat the main points of the first E-Learning module  \\n in a series in the last one.  \\n To paraphrase learning expert Will Thalheimer,  \\n \\\"Repeating core concepts  \\n \\\"throughout a learning experience is  \\n \\\"a simple proven way to get people to remember  \\n \\\"what we taught 'em.\\\"  \\n So here goes.  \\n Identify what you love  \\n and infuse it into your digital solution.  \\n Embrace the technical glitches.  \\n Mix up the way you present material.  \\n Modularize your content.  \\n And repeat your core ideas.  \\n Do these five things and you'll be quick on your way  \\n to developing robust digital solutions.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319275\",\"duration\":133,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Gain support for your digital blend\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_05_02_XR30_support\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about effective ways of obtaining stakeholder support for a digital learning solution.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":4364971,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] Most digital learning programs are a blend.  \\n There's often some elearning,  \\n an instructor-led component, some performance support,  \\n and maybe even a little bit of social learning.  \\n Because of that, there's a lot of people involved.  \\n There's the learners of course.  \\n There's the supervisors  \\n who may play an active part in the training.  \\n Say assessing a learner's on the job skill  \\n as well as supporting the training back on the job.  \\n There are managers and directors  \\n who champion the training throughout the organization  \\n and step in if there's a problem.  \\n All of these people need to understand  \\n what the training program consists of  \\n and what their role is in making it a success.  \\n Essentially, you need their support.  \\n How do you go about getting that?

A 2.5% sales increase is still pretty good.  \\n It works out to $150,000 per year for five stores.  \\n Good, right?  \\n Well, the chief financial officer might point out  \\n that we're using revenue for our calculation,  \\n not gross profit.  \\n Gross profit is revenue minus the cost of goods sold.  \\n Here's what happens when we use gross profit  \\n for our ROI calculation.  \\n Let's say the average gross profit  \\n at our retail stores is 35%.  \\n We can multiply this by our pilot revenue gain of $150,000  \\n to see a $52,500 annual gross profit gain.  \\n To calculate ROI,  \\n we subtract the $25,500 program cost from the $52,500 gain  \\n and then divide that number by the cost of the program.  \\n This yields 106% return on investment.  \\n Okay, all this math might make your head hurt a little,  \\n but it explains how executives and trainers  \\n often see things differently.  \\n A trainer might say,  \\n \\\"Hey, this new sales training program  \\n increased sales by $150,000.\\\"  \\n An executive might say,  \\n \\\"Well, according to my math, we only gained $27,000.\\\"  \\n Now, this was a pilot with five stores.  \\n Let's look at the projected ROI  \\n if we roll it out to all 100 stores in the chain.  \\n We'll take the $5,100 training cost per store  \\n and multiply that by 100 stores.  \\n Next, we'll multiply that $510,000 total cost  \\n by the 106% ROI to get an expected net gain of $540,600.  \\n Okay, now I know again, that's a lot of math,  \\n so I've put all the numbers for this example  \\n on the downloadable sample ROI calculation worksheet.  \\n You won't use the ROI model for every training program,  \\n but this example highlights a situation  \\n where it can be very helpful.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3072565\",\"duration\":191,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Brinkerhoff's Success Case Method\",\"fileName\":\"479801_en_US_01_03_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about the Success Case Method.

 \\n Level two, can supervisors demonstrate the ability  \\n to use the new procedures?  \\n And do supervisors love the new procedures?  \\n And we can also evaluate level one,  \\n how do supervisors react to the training?  \\n Now we need decide how we'll capture this data.  \\n We can measure turnover by analyzing data  \\n from our company's human resources  \\n information system, or HRIS.  \\n One way to know if supervisors  \\n are following the new procedures  \\n is to ask regional managers  \\n to observe their supervisors conducting interviews.  \\n Conducting mock interviews at the end of the training class  \\n will let us know whether supervisors learn  \\n to follow the new procedures.  \\n And we can give supervisors a short post-training survey  \\n to gauge how much they like the new procedures  \\n and how they reacted to the training.  \\n You can download the sample evaluation plan file  \\n to see the entire sample strategy  \\n for this interviewing skills project.  \\n Now, I encourage you to create an evaluation strategy  \\n for one of your training projects.  \\n You can download the evaluation strategy checklist  \\n to use as a guide.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3068505\",\"duration\":104,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Gain support for your evaluation plan\",\"fileName\":\"479801_en_US_02_03_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Explore the steps you should take to get buy-in from project sponsors and create your evaluation plan.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":1606993,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Once you create an evaluation strategy,  \\n you'll need to get buy-in  \\n from your project sponsor.  \\n Here are a few steps you should take.  \\n The first step is to summarize  \\n your evaluation strategy  \\n in a clear plan that can be shared  \\n with your project sponsor,  \\n and other key stakeholders.  \\n Here are a few things you might include  \\n in your plan.  \\n A project description.  \\n Your measurement goals.  \\n The evaluation strategy.  \\n A data collection plan  \\n that includes timeframes.  \\n A list of project team members,  \\n and your communication plan.  \\n Once you complete a written plan,  \\n it's important to share it  \\n with your project sponsor,  \\n and other key stakeholders to get their buy-in.  \\n Let's imagine we've created  \\n a strategy to evaluate  \\n an interviewing skills training program.  \\n You can download my sample evaluation plan  \\n to see all the details and use it  \\n as a guide for creating your own plan.  \\n I shared this plan with Stacy Jones,  \\n the project sponsor to get her buy-in.  \\n We walked through the measurement steps,  \\n and I explained how we could use it  \\n to make sure the training program  \\n met her objectives.  \\n We also read upon a timeline  \\n for reporting back on the results.  \\n Keep in mind,  \\n there are often multiple stakeholders  \\n for measurement projects like this one.  \\n For example,  \\n workshop includes having regional managers  \\n observe their supervisors  \\n conducting interviews  \\n to make sure they're using the new process.  \\n I'll need to share my plan  \\n with those regional managers to make sure  \\n they're on board.  \\n Evaluating a training program  \\n can take time, money and resources.  \\n So it's important to get your sponsors buy-in  \\n for your plan  \\n before you implement it.  \\n As a next step,  \\n I recommend creating an evaluation plan  \\n for one of your training programs,  \\n and sharing it with a sponsor  \\n to get their approval.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3073541\",\"duration\":130,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Manage data collection\",\"fileName\":\"479801_en_US_02_04_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn how to collect and manage the data required for your evaluation projects.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":1986037,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Once you create a strategy to evaluate  \\n your training program, you have to implement your plan.  \\n There are a few things you should do  \\n in this stage of the process.  \\n Apply consistent and accurate methods,  \\n monitor ongoing data collection,  \\n and document the data in a format that's easily accessible,  \\n like a spreadsheet or database.  \\n Let's use an interviewing skills training program  \\n as an example to illustrate  \\n how these considerations come into play.  \\n Our overall goal is to reduce turnover among new hires  \\n within their first 90 days from 30% down to 15%.  \\n We can measure this by analyzing data in our company's  \\n human resources information system, or HRIS.  \\n This is a database that contains  \\n all sorts of employee information,  \\n but how do we know that data is accurate?

 \\n How do you start the process  \\n with so many different pieces and elements?  \\n Here's my recommendation  \\n for putting all this information into practice.  \\n First, define your instructional goal.  \\n What do you want the learners to be able to do  \\n when they've completed your branching scenario?  \\n What is the learning outcome?  \\n What you want to do is break the ultimate goal  \\n into sub-goals that are taught during the scenario.  \\n These decisions are key  \\n because they will guide all the other design  \\n and development decisions that you make.  \\n Next, you need to determine the right sequence  \\n of decisions and consequences  \\n that will propel the learner through the scenario.  \\n I start with how to do the task correctly  \\n and then go back and add the distractors and wrong choices.  \\n Remember, wrong choices should be based on common mistakes  \\n or misconceptions, so the learner is practicing  \\n how they would behave and respond  \\n just as they would in the actual situation or experience.  \\n As you are creating the right path through the content,  \\n you need to continually consider the setting,  \\n situations, and characters that will inhabit your scenario.  \\n Who is the learner going to be interacting with  \\n while they learn?  \\n What situation will they be thrust into  \\n to start the scenario?  \\n When you think about the characters and situations,  \\n make sure you properly recognize  \\n the diversity of individuals  \\n the learner will interact with  \\n during this type of situation.  \\n At this point, you'll want to review  \\n or create the alternative branches the learner could take  \\n as they progress through the scenario.  \\n You'll want to keep it as simple as possible,  \\n but when you are designing a scenario  \\n to practice a real-life situation,  \\n things can get complicated.  \\n Use techniques like the constrained path design method  \\n to keep your design as simple as possible.  \\n If a learner is truly headed down a wrong path,  \\n it might be a good idea to just end the path  \\n and not create an entire branch.  \\n As you design, consider what type of feedback  \\n you'll be providing.  \\n Do you want the characters to provide natural feedback?  \\n Do you need to add some artificial feedback  \\n to highlight key learning elements?  \\n Should the feedback be immediate, delayed,  \\n or summative, or most likely a combination?  \\n Think about these decisions as you craft the story  \\n and the correct path through the content.  \\n One thing that is helpful to me  \\n that could be helpful to you  \\n would be using tools to help design  \\n and visualize your branching scenarios.  \\n I have included a few of these options  \\n in the exercise files.  \\n Finally, have fun with the entire process.  \\n Add some mystery or intrigue to your branching scenario.  \\n Include some surprises.  \\n Creating an instructional branching scenario  \\n is an opportunity for you to put on your director's hat  \\n and create an engaging, exciting experience for the learner.  \\n Remember, the level of excitement, engagement,  \\n and learning within a branching scenario is up to you.  \\n If you want to learn even more techniques  \\n for creating engaging instruction,  \\n see my course, \\\"Learning How to Increase  \\n \\\"Learner Engagement.\\\"  \\n And if you want to take it up another notch,  \\n see one of my courses on gamification,  \\n such as \\\"Gamification of Learning.\\\"  \\n You can get in touch with me  \\n and keep up with the latest on interactive learning  \\n by following me, Karl Kapp, on LinkedIn.  \\n Have fun with your branching scenarios.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Conclusion\",\"size\":15018510,\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentChapter:3085106\"}],\"size\":215215320,\"duration\":3270,\"zeroBased\":false},{\"course_title\":\"Project Management for Designers\",\"course_admin_id\":734638,\"metadata\":{\"Locale\":\"en_US\",\"Course ID\":734638,\"Project ID\":null,\"Course Name\":\"Project Management for Designers\",\"Course Name EN\":\"Project Management for Designers\",\"Activation Status\":\"ACTIVE\",\"Display to Public\":\"Yes\",\"Display to QA\":\"No\",\"Course Description\":\"For designers juggling a slew of clients and projects, project management is a critical tool that can help them stay organized, prioritize, collaborate, and keep up with the current tasks at hand.

is project management?\\nIn general, project management is the process\\nof achieving specific goals\\nthat meet specific success criteria\\nwithin a specified timeline.\\nMore simply put, it's getting your project done\\non-time, under budget, and with few to no mistakes.\\nAs many of you may know, this isn't always that simple,\\nbut I've been earning my successes\\nand refining my project management processes for years,\\nand through those experiences,\\nI developed some great approaches and techniques\\nto help you consistently deliver well-managed projects.\\n\\nI believe that to be successful,\\nyou have to understand the fundamentals,\\nand the value of a project well-managed.\\nA well-managed project accomplishes so many things.\\nFor example, it lessens stress\\nby reducing mistakes and increasing communication.\\nIt improves your work because you're asking\\nthe right questions at the right time,\\nand this allows your project to run smoothly internally\\nwith third parties and with your clients.\\nProject management done right\\nmeans that your project will finish\\non time and within budget, which makes everyone happy.\\nBut, a project well-managed also includes steps\\nbuilt into the process to predict challenges,\\noverages, or snags before they happen,\\nso you can address them proactively versus reactively.\\n\\nWhen I talk to colleagues about a project\\nthat went sideways, there is almost always some piece\\nof that project that could have been handled better.\\nMy philosophy is having a project management\\nprocess that is well-defined,\\ncommunicated about clearly, and looked at regularly.\\nThis ensures that the process is not only relevant,\\nbut also flexible for different types of projects\\nand cultures you may work with.\\nWithin project management, there are several factors\\nyou need to understand.\\nThe first factor is having the vision\\nof a project's life cycle,\\nand an awareness of the unique steps within that cycle.\\n\\nThe next is your culture, and in many ways,\\nthis might be the most important.\\nWe often forget that a methodology\\ndoesn't do the work and manage the project, people do.\\nSo understanding your personnel\\nand making sure they buy into your approach is key.\\nAnd finally, it's your clients.\\nWork hard to find clients that can help you achieve\\nyour project and work goals whenever possible.\\nWhen I talk about a project life cycle,\\nI'm talking about the stages we go through\\nin every project, no matter what.\\nThose can be broken up in several ways,\\nbut these are the two most common types\\nthat I think are relevant for design.\\n\\nThe first is a waterfall approach,\\ncomprised of static phases executed in a specific order.\\nRequirements, design, testing,\\nimplementation, and maintenance.\\nThe second is an agile form.\\nPlan, design, develop, implement,\\nevaluate, and repeat.\\nYou can play with these a bit to fit your culture\\nand your client communication.\\nAt my design firm, we have found that a hybrid\\nworks best for us.\\nAs an example, we simplified\\nour project management process into three stages:\\nAsk, think, and create.\\n\\nWithin each of these stages, we define our approach,\\nand our project management steps\\nbased on the type of project we are doing.\\nIn other words, the process generally stays the same,\\nbut will have nuanced steps to address the uniqueness\\nthat a local project has versus that of a web project.\\nBut the general steps for all project management systems\\nare pretty standard.\\nLaunching and scoping the project,\\nresearching everything that goes\\ninto formulating your solution.\\nTesting those theories.\\nPrototyping, designing, tweaking the solution.\\nLaunching the project, closing the project,\\nwhich can include monitoring results\\nand providing next steps,\\nor just closing the project with the client\\nand moving on to what's next.\\n\\nAlong with this life cycle,\\nthere are bound to be unique steps\\nyour team needs to know and execute\\nwithin each one of the above stages.\\nThese will vary depending on project type,\\nwhether you're working on a strategy project,\\na logo project, or a web or environmental project.\\nEach of these have unique nuances\\nthat need to be defined for each stage,\\nand will of course also take different resources\\nfinancially, time-wise, and team-wise.\\nAnd finally, this is another piece\\nthat isn't talked about enough.\\nIn order to manage your project appropriately,\\nyou must incorporate your client's specific needs\\nfor approval, timing, and budget as well.\\n\\nSo to recap, to manage a project well,\\nyou have to define what approach of project management\\nbest fits your culture.\\nDocument the various nuances based on the type of project,\\nand understand how to incorporate your client's\\ncommunication needs in the project.\\nThis takes some time and work,\\nbut once done, it will reduce issues,\\nand increase the successful outcome for all involved.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5028674\",\"duration\":300,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"What are you good

steps to help each member\\nof the team get through a project smoothly is necessary\\nto have any hope of staying profitable, growing,\\nserving clients well, and reducing stress.\\n\\nThe best processes are simple ones\\nthat are easy to understand\\nand have clear stages and goals.\\nIf everyone knows the process and expectations,\\nthe more success you will have.\\nIf we do not get communication right,\\nit can ruin a relationship and cripple a culture.\\nThere is no project management approach\\nwhere not communicating is acceptable.\\nAll key stakeholders have to know who is on the team,\\nkey dates, changes, timing, risks, issues, and so on\\nto be able to do their part and avoid mistakes.\\n\\nAnother way to say this is\\nthat clear and constant communication is the breath\\nof every project.\\nWithout it, your project will meet a painful conclusion.\\nEvery project, no matter how small or large,\\nneeds to be launched and documented.\\nYou want to make sure everyone on the team,\\nincluding vendors and clients,\\nknow the details and roles to be played.\\nThis is paramount to setting everyone up for success.\\nBen Franklin said it best,\\n\\\"By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\\\"\\nThe project kickoff is the key to future success.\\n\\nClearly setting expectations, goals,\\nand details allows a team to be more self-dependent,\\nand self-organized.\\nManaging a project\\nfor a seasoned person can be difficult at times,\\nand it's even more so\\nfor someone lacking experience or skill.\\nBefore you assign someone on your team\\nto manage all or part of a project,\\nmake sure they are the best option.\\nI know at times we fall into the trap\\nof assigning people to a project\\nbecause they're available\\nversus assessing if we could make other changes\\nin order to get the best people on the right project.\\n\\nI realize at times, you may not have this option,\\nand that's when clarity\\nand communication become even more important.\\nBut take a second and assess what your options are.\\nI'm a firm believer in challenging my teammates\\nto get better or to learn on the job.\\nBut again, be careful to throw an inexperienced person\\ninto a situation that's over their head.\\nIt would be best to have a junior project manager\\nor have a creative shadow a more seasoned peer\\nbefore releasing them into a solo project.\\nListening is key to project management,\\nespecially listening to your team.\\n\\nWhen project managers ignore suggestions,\\ndon't ask for input or avoid questions,\\nit's a recipe for trouble.\\nNot only will the team stop asking questions,\\nlearning opportunities will not happen,\\nand assumptions creep in\\nthat can take a project off the rails\\nright from the beginning.\\nTrust me, you'll get further together\\nthan you will by yourself.\\nProject management is as much about process\\nas it is about people.\\nLet your team do what they are great at.\\nIf a project is well-defined,\\ncommunication is open, and check-ins exist,\\nthings will go well.\\n\\nTrust goes a long way to helping people own their work\\nand stay motivated.\\nAnd great teamwork helps everyone have a good experience\\nfrom start to finish.\\nThis pitfall can go both ways.\\nYou can depend on technology too much,\\nbut the most concerning issue is if you're not using any.\\nSoftware will not solve your project's problems.\\nPeople do that.\\nBut using software tools help you stay organized,\\nplan, track time, collaborate,\\nand assess risk and profitability.\\nAlso, clients today will assume you are using\\nsome sort of software to manage a project professionally.\\n\\nSoftware can help solve problems,\\nand show ways to improve,\\nbut like

some step that was overlooked,\\nthe best way to handle it is to own it\\nand follow up with the next steps and solution.\\nThink about these common pitfalls\\nand see which ones are most challenging

with commitment.\\nCommitted project management mean being invested\\nin seeing the project work from start to finish.\\nYou believe in the work that you're doing\\nand commitment helps you achieve\\nthe best results throughout.\\n\\nWe don't live in a perfect world\\nso being ready for the unexpected and still\\npowering throughs keeps everyone going\\nin a positive direction.\\nProject management does not depend on one person.\\nThe project manager delegates, listens\\nto all involved, adjusts accordingly, and stays positive.\\nThis simple act helps all feel that you're in it\\nand will motivate the group to be in it too.\\nOne of my favorite quotes when thinking\\nabout this is from Brian Tracy,\\n\\\"The more you teach positive ideas to others,\\n\\\"the better you learn them yourself.\\\"\\nIt may seem obvious that communication is a part\\nof project management.\\n\\nEven though everyone agrees that communication\\nis important, yet it is something we all\\nconstantly talk about improving.\\nI think the challenge is that we are often good\\nat communicating certain points during a project\\nbut the secret is really constant\\nand consistent communication.\\nI'm not talking about lengthly emails\\nor chain messages to everyone.\\nI mean communicating to the right parties at the right time.\\nThat should be a part of your planning.\\nBig messages may go out regularly as you take\\na look at a project and do a comprehensive\\naudit on where everything is at, but regular\\ncommunications to team members, vendors,\\nand clients are paramount.\\n\\nFigure out the best ways to do that and then\\nshare that information when needed to people involved.\\nThis really comes down to where the money\\nis in project management, and that is working in the grays.\\n(indistinct) talk about process tips and tricks,\\ntough clients and common struggles, but there\\nare gray areas in almost every project at some point.\\nAnd effectively dealing in the gray is essential.\\nIn fact, this is a must-have skill in project\\nmanagement because no matter the size\\nof the company, industry, or how many times\\nyou have done that type of work,\\nthere will be moments where you will not\\nhave all the info you need and you will need\\nto navigate through that.\\n\\nOften these grays come out of areas\\nthat the project manager cannot control.\\nAnd you have to be able to manage that challenge.\\nKeeping your cool when timing gets changed,\\nbudgets get cut, or there's an unknown\\ninjected into your project, is an ability\\nthat needs to be mastered because it's a certainty\\nin project management.\\nWorking well in these three areas will bring\\nyour project positivity, clarity,\\nand confident leadership, and these qualities\\nwill help your project and team ultimately be profitable.\\nAnd if these things happen consistently\\nyou will make some money too, which other\\nthan keeping you in business helps you sleep\\na little bit better at

the bank and I was feeling depressed.\\nHow can I be so busy and work so hard\\nand yet barely be able to eke out a living?\\nThere are many factors that were causing\\nany number of issues,\\nbut one of the key factors that when I started a project\\nwith a client I did not have an onboarding process\\nfor that project.\\n\\nCommunication and developing a strong relationship\\nwith the client all starts with the onboarding\\nand it's essential.\\nThe definition of onboarding is familiarizing a new customer\\nor client with one's products or services.\\nI would add to that definition that onboarding\\nis also warmly welcoming your client\\nand using the kickoff meeting to gain understanding\\nof your client's unique communication needs,\\nsetting expectations, introducing them to your process,\\nand building in project controls.\\nThe first step to onboarding is the welcome.\\nIdeally we try to have a face-to-face or video kickoff.\\n\\nWith new clients we take the time to send a welcome email.\\nWe send this regardless of the form our kickoff takes.\\nThis welcome email includes some key information.\\nWe first share a PDF that highlights\\nthe general process we take when we do a project.\\nWe let the client know that we believe communication is key\\nand we ask them if they're familiar\\nwith the project management software we use.\\nCurrently we use Asana,\\nbecause that works best for our team,\\nbut the software is just a tool.\\nSo if the client if familiar with Asana\\nwe move onto the next step.\\nBut if not, we tell them not to worry,\\nwe will set them up and then share with them how it works.\\n\\nEven if they prefer other forms of communication,\\nface-to-face meetings, video chats, phone calls,\\nor just using email,\\nwe reinforce the value of this software\\nand set them up with it anyways.\\nThat way in case they ever want to check in\\nthere's a spot they can go to any time, any place.\\nYears ago this was a sticking point for some clients\\nand we still do get clients occasionally\\nwho do not want to learn or deal with one more thing.\\nIf that is the case and we value the client, we adjust.\\nBut the majority of the time having access to this\\nis a relief for our clients and very welcome.\\n\\nWe then go back over the agreements, contracts,\\nscope of work, and rough schedule,\\nand make sure all is good to go and officially authorized.\\nIf nothing has changed we move on.\\nIf something has we simply address it right there\\nand make the necessary adjustments.\\nNext, we make any team introductions\\nand talk about the roles\\neach team member will play on our side.\\nWe confirm on the client's side who will lead\\nthe key communication touch points for the project.\\nThis is a big moment.\\nHaving clarity about who will communicate what\\non each team is crucial.\\n\\nWe reinforce again the way the project will be communicated\\nand, this is important as well,\\nour expectations about the client's responses.\\nA key project control point is client sign-off and feedback.\\nWe make sure we've identified\\nthe approval process on their side\\nand we make note if any adjustments need to be made.\\nWe made need to present more in person\\nor build in extra time for a traveling boss.\\nWe ask as many questions up front,\\nso we can plan for any possible challenges.\\nWe also communicate to our client\\nany issues we may have coming up.\\nVacations or other obligations may change\\nthe points of contact throughout the project\\nand we want the client to feel taken care of\\nand not

even when you don't have the project yet,\\nthere is still some project management going on.\\nWhen scoping a project in the proposal phase,\\nwe have a conversation with any vendors,\\nwhether these are artists, paper vendors,\\nprinters, coaters and photographers.\\nWe ask them how long they will need based\\non our project start date.\\nThis is not set in stone\\nbut having this conversation has helped our relationships\\nand helped us be more accurate.\\nWe also ask the client when the due date is\\nand then we simply work backwards from there.\\n\\nWe take into account any and all factors we can\\nand we create a general outline\\nwith the caveat that once a job is awarded,\\nthis needs to be looked at again\\nand refined where necessary.\\nOnce the project is awarded,\\nwe go back over any required client steps\\nwhen it comes to getting information and sign offs.\\nIf there are any potential concerns,\\nwe make note of them\\nand start figuring out how to work around those\\nin order to keep the project on track.\\nThese can include the need for committee sign-off,\\na boss that may travel or be hard to get ahold of,\\nand working with other departments\\nwho might have scheduling conflicts\\nsuch as vacations, holidays,\\nor trade shows that may interfere with the timing.\\n\\nIf at this point there's anything alarming,\\nsuch as a reduction in time or a major holiday,\\nwe speak up right then\\nand have a transparent conversation about any concerns.\\nIf need be, we get back to the client\\nwith the recommended course of action\\nbut we always talk about concerns\\nwith a solution-oriented posture.\\nWe want the client to know\\nthat when there are concerns,\\nwe are committed to figuring things out.\\nWe then have a similar conversation\\nwith any vendors to make sure everything is still good\\nand they are still available.\\nYears ago we were helping develop a product\\nfor a big trade show.\\n\\nEveryone involved promised to make it happen on schedule\\nonly to find out that the manufacturer\\nwho was overseas was taking a couple weeks off\\nfor a national holiday.\\nIf we had checked in at the start,\\nand shared the schedule with this manufacturer\\nwe could have avoided an awful couple of weeks\\nand losing thousands of dollars to make the trade show.\\nAfter we have all the necessary information,\\nwe then look at our schedule\\nand choose the best team for that project.\\nWe then start building a general outline\\nof the project.\\nIf everything works, we then add monthly,\\nweekly and daily steps and dates.\\n\\nWe double check with the vendor on their dates\\nand if they are green lighted,\\nwe email a schedule with our delivery dates\\nto the client and ask them to confirm\\nor ask for any adjustments.\\nFinally, we use our project management software\\nto help us track the project and allow all parties\\nto have the information at the ready.\\nWith the majority of the schedule built out,\\nwe next make sure that we highlight a key part\\nof the project management schedule,\\nmilestones or key dates are paramount\\nto monitoring and tracking the success of a

When you create the project schedule,\\nyou need to make sure you identify\\nand highlight the key milestones.\\nThe important phases in the process.\\nThis will help you find opportunities to communicate\\nand give you checkpoints to maintain control\\nas much as possible.\\nThis is not called scheduling part two.\\nThese milestones are internal dates, vendor dates,\\nand client presentation and approval dates.\\nIn other words, these are built-in for you as fail-safe\\nto make sure you are on top of all the details.\\nHere are some of the common milestones you should highlight\\nand share with key parties.\\n\\nFirst, the most simple way to think about a milestone\\nis by starting with the biggest two,\\nthe start date and the end date.\\nSecond, break the schedule into milestones based\\non the type of project you are doing.\\nA great way to think about a milestone is when\\na significant action is happening in the project.\\nLet's say you're beginning to set up interviews\\nfor the brand research on a particular date.\\nThere will be some activities or steps in between\\nthat and the next milestone, which would be presenting brand\\nresearch to the client on such-and-such a date.\\nA vendor milestone might be something like sending files\\nfor a vendor to start quoting a website.\\n\\nThere would be some steps in between this\\nand the next milestone, which might be the vendor presenting\\na working beta for us to review.\\nA client milestone could be the client giving us all\\nthe current brand materials so we can start a brand audit.\\nAnd just as before, there are probably some internal steps\\nthat have to happen before the next milestone,\\nwhich might be presenting client brand recommendations after\\nthe audit is complete.\\nThe key to all these milestones is that they are often\\nthe biggest dates in the schedule.\\nIt's typically something that must be started,\\ngiven to you with a sign off, ready for production,\\na presentation, or completed.\\n\\nIf any of those dates are in jeopardy,\\nthe dates right before and right after them are as well.\\nAnd often, while a task in between might\\nhave some flexibility based on schedules,\\nyour milestones are the dates that must be hit\\nto get things done, delivered on time,\\nand for the project to be profitable.\\nSome methodologies do not stress milestones\\nas being key budgetary factors or checkpoints.\\nI have found though, that for the creative process,\\nthey have worked brilliantly for us.\\nBut whatever your scheduling process is,\\nthere are key moments in any schedule that indicate\\nto you if you're on time, on budget,\\nand need to communicate to any key stakeholders.\\n\\nWhen we are on any part of the creative phase,\\nI know based on our presentation date\\nor when we need to send something to coding,\\nif we are on time or on budget.\\nIf we are lagging, I know the steps we need to take\\nto get back on track.\\nIf I check in with a print vendor\\nand find out the proofs are going to be late,\\nor if a web vendor has not sent beta to us yet,\\nI know the steps needed to find to why\\nand whether or not this will affect\\nour delivery and profitability.\\nWhen a client misses a data collection milestone\\nor an approval milestone, I know we need to adjust\\nexpectations, the schedule, and maybe even the budget.\\n\\nI also know that this might have a negative domino effect\\non the rest of the project.\\nConversely, if we're ahead of milestones,\\nwe can decide to over deliver, take some more time\\nwith certain aspects of the project,\\nor spend that energy elsewhere.\\nMilestones are designed to give you a barometer\\nof the status of the project with everyone involved.\\nThey help you to manage from a 10,000-foot view\\nand identify when you need to dig in and tackle one\\nof the most challenging parts of this process,\\ndealing with

to be sure you master\\nin order to problem predict your projects.\\nThe first is what we call project clarity.\\nAn easy test to determine clarity is asking\\nif you can easily state\\nto anyone in your team the expectations for that project.\\n\\nWhat are the needed deliverables?\\nWhat does success of this project look like?\\nThis may seem obvious, but it's shocking\\nthat on many projects, all three\\nof these questions cannot be clearly articulated.\\nA great predictor is how confident you feel\\nby your answers here, what do you need\\nto get more clarity on?\\nThe next one is the easiest predictor in my opinion\\nbut again it's one we commonly think\\nwe can bend, and that is time.\\nThe world is more and more competitive.\\nPeople want things faster and faster for less and less.\\nBut things just take time.\\n\\nIf I was to ask all of you watching this to raise your hand\\nand state how many of your projects\\nhave finished on time 100% of the time,\\nI'm confident the number would be zero.\\nI believe project timelines most often slip\\ndue to unrealistic initial deadlines.\\nFor this reason, you want to be\\nvery disciplined with your time,\\nlet the client know that if they miss a deadline,\\nyou'll automatically add two days to the schedule.\\nDo whatever you can do to highlight the importance\\nof timeliness, but again,\\nthe greatest contributing factor\\nis to give yourself as much time as you can with input\\nfrom vendors and stakeholders.\\n\\nIt's always a challenge to apply clear\\nand timely communication,\\nbut having the communications challenges\\nfigured out is a key predictor.\\nThis can take several forms,\\nbut I think it's important\\nto have your internal communications worked out first.\\nEspecially today with the teams being more virtual\\nand often built with freelancers,\\ninternal communications should be clear,\\neasy, able to be documented when needed,\\nand expectations should be clearly understood.\\nStanding production meetings,\\nthe use of collaboration tools,\\nand frequent check-ins need to happen.\\n\\nThis then also has to transfer to vendors and clients.\\nSo when you're looking at a project,\\nfigure out any communication challenges and plan for them.\\nDon't pretend that this project\\nwill be better than the rest.\\nHope for it, be positive about it,\\nbut manage it in a way that gives you some space just\\nin case it's not what you think\\nor ends up being more challenging.\\nManaging risk is another big factor.\\nNow, of course this depends on the type\\nof work you do and your industry.\\nAre you working for a startup,\\na financial organization, or a nonprofit?\\nIf so, the market or some\\nsort of funding could greatly influence what happens during\\nthe course of the project,\\nor more practically, what do you do if a key employee\\ngets sick or your vendor drops out?\\nDon't live in la-la land.\\n\\nInstead, think about what could happen.\\nPredict the possibilities and plan for them.\\nWork on some control measures\\nthat can help you deal with\\nthe risks should they come to pass.\\nThis means you'll not only be ready\\nfor the worst case scenario,\\nbut also gives you a level head\\nand take some of the anxiety and fear away.\\nAll of these predictors and any that you think\\nof that are unique to your culture,\\nalong with some project management software\\nand collaboration, can help with much of this.\\nThis is not so much a solution as a tool,\\nbut it's a worthy tool to help\\nyou manage possible problems and finish

a part of that project management.\\nAll members of the team need to understand the role,\\nand what's expected from them to deliver on that promise.\\nLet me go back to the restaurant example.\\nFirst you call the restaurant to make your reservations,\\nand the person you speak to is polite and helpful.\\nYou then get an email or text followup\\nthat everything is set.\\nWhen you get to the restaurant,\\nyour interaction with the valet, the host, or hostess,\\nand the server are all part of an experience in that meal.\\n\\nHow the staff takes care of you,\\nfilling your water, paying attention to your requests,\\nthinking of what you might need in advance,\\nbeing well-informed about the menus,\\nall this takes place before you even take a bite.\\nThe ease of communication,\\nand the feeling of being taken care of are powerful.\\nAnd then there is the food.\\nLike a chef, you need to deliver a great solution,\\nand even if you don't love it,\\nif it is executed well, you can tell your din\\nwas someone with talent and skill from the appetizers,\\nto the dessert.\\nIf all of these are handled thoughtfully,\\nand purposefully, the impression is one of quality.\\n\\nThis makes you want to go back,\\npaying more, and recommending the restaurant to others.\\nThose are all things we aim for.\\nLet's take the concepts from the restaurant example,\\nand adapt them for project management.\\nIt starts with the way you attract and onboard an client.\\nThe questions you ask,\\nthe technology you use to track and manage the job,\\nthe piece of mind you communicate,\\nand organization you demonstrate all help\\nto put your client at ease.\\nThe entire management process,\\nand the delivery of the solution\\nis part of the project experience.\\n\\nEven if there are bumps in the road,\\ndid you communicate well, and manage quickly,\\nknowledgeably and respectfully?\\nAnd then after the project was there clear communication\\non delivery and followup?\\nHaving a well-defined standard of project management\\nis key to a successful project,\\nand long-term client relationships.\\nSome of the key factors to consider\\nis that there are several project management stages\\nthat can differ depending on the type of project.\\nYour approach may vary with the size of your company,\\nbecause many different employees\\ncan take part in this process.\\nBefore you get into breaking down your experience\\nfrom top to bottom,\\nyou first need to decide\\nwhether you're committed to managing your project\\nat this level.\\n\\nBecause it doesn't just happen.\\nYou have to set a standard,\\nand constantly look at evolving and improving

quote,\\n\\\"A goal without a plan is just a wish,\\\"\\nby the French poet Saint-Exupery.\\nTo me it sends up the need for your project\\nmanagement process to be written out,\\ntaught well to your team,\\nand clearly shared with your collaborators and clients.\\nIf your goal is to have excellence in project management,\\na plan is exactly what needs to happen.\\nA good plan for project management\\nhas four key characteristics.\\n\\nFirst, it has clear objectives.\\nSecond, it is as simple as possible.\\nThird, it has points of analysis and assessment.\\nFourth, it's flexible and suitable\\nfor the type of objective you're trying to accomplish.\\nWhen you're assessing the type of project management\\nyou're going to implement in your studio,\\nyou first need to decide on your objectives.\\nThese can shift based on the size of the firm you are,\\nthe type of work you do,\\nand what has worked and not worked so far.\\nSo first, figure out what your objectives are.\\n\\nThey could be to have more efficiency,\\nbe better at tracking details,\\nbe more profitable, have smoother communication, and so on.\\nWhatever they are, make sure you define those\\nfor every touchpoint on the process.\\nSecond, make sure your plan for project management\\nis as simple as possible.\\nPeople are the ones that manage projects,\\nand for a level of consistent excellence,\\nit is important to not overcomplicate the process.\\nI believe that documenting your process is crucial.\\nThat way your team can look at the plan anytime,\\nprint it out, and study it for understanding.\\n\\nDocumentation also allows you to review it regularly,\\nand share those changes easily.\\nAdditionally, picking the right\\nproject management software is important too,\\nso take your time to research this.\\nRemember that simplicity needs to work internally,\\nas well as externally.\\nThe third point of having analysis and assessment\\ngoes hand in hand with your having milestones\\nand regular check-ins.\\nThe timing and amount of these\\nanalysis and assessment points\\nwill vary with the experience of your team,\\nthe complexity of the project,\\nthe demands of your client, and where you feel comfortable.\\n\\nThe general rule I use is that you cannot\\noverdo these steps or over-communicate internally.\\nI would rather over-communicate,\\nand pull back after an assessment of a project,\\nthen under-communicate and pay the consequences of mistakes,\\nlost revenue, lost clients, or even the loss of a job.\\nCommunication is vital to make sure\\nall key milestones, approvals,\\nspecifications and major details\\nare documented and shared.\\nThe same goes for client and vendor\\nanalysis and assessment,\\nand this can be a little trickier,\\nbut I'd rather over-communicate\\nthan under-communicate here too.\\n\\nAnd then adjust after a successful project.\\nI have yet to have a client get upset\\nwith us for over-communicating.\\nThe worst feedback I ever received from a client\\nwas that at times the communication was overwhelming,\\nbut they also appreciated that we would always\\nfollow-up with a call and walk them through everything.\\nIn other words, I have never lost a client\\nby over-communicating, but I have lost clients\\nwhen I've under-communicated.\\nOkay, the last part of your plan for project management\\nis making sure there is some flexibility built into it.\\n\\nIn our creative space,\\nthe process of creating a logo,\\ndeveloping a website,\\nor coming up with a motion graphic video\\nhas some similar steps but also many different steps.\\nYour project management needs to be able\\nto flex when need be while still\\nhelping you deliver at the level you have set for your team.\\nSome of your clients want regular updates,\\nwhile others seem to disappear,\\nand there are many who fall in between these two extremes.\\nSo you have to remain flexible\\nwhile at the same time setting some immovable ground rules.\\nAll of these points are only effective\\nif they are shared with your team.\\n\\nWe review our approach at least once a year\\nor anytime we adjust the way we execute\\na certain type of project.\\nFor example, when we changed our approach to web design,\\nwe simultaneously updated our project management process.\\nWe documented it on our Google Work Drive,\\nand in our project management system.\\nWe also created a simple pdf that gave our clients\\na 10000 foot view of our steps,\\nso they knew what to expect.\\nWe use that document all the way through the process\\nto keep us all in sync.\\nSome firms have more visual software\\nso the team can see the project as it progresses.\\nSome even have the general approach\\npainted on their studio wall.\\n\\nHowever it works for you culturally\\nto share your approach with your team, do it,\\nbecause a goal without a plan is just a wish.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5028686\",\"duration\":182,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Do you have project and post-project

board?\\nIn my experience, it is not enough at times.\\nSome are more wired to think\\nabout the project management aspect of the business,\\nand others are not, but that is not an excuse in my book.\\n\\nI've learned the importance\\nof making sure project management\\nis written into each team member's job description.\\nAn ongoing conversation about how that plays out\\nneeds to happen from the initial interview\\nto regular performance reviews.\\nWe have team members at my company\\nwhose main responsibility is project management.\\nAnd although they are the keepers of that process,\\nthey still are just a part\\nof the project management process as a whole.\\nAnd although that may seem obvious,\\nI stress this because the project manager,\\nif you have a dedicated PM,\\nis only one piece of that project.\\n\\nThe designers, writers, coders, illustrators, strategists,\\nand anyone else on your team\\nalso share project management responsibilities.\\nThey all need to understand that and buy into it\\nor you'll be constantly banging your head\\ninto the wall of frustration.\\nThe best way to deal with this is to give each\\nof your members an idea\\nThey all exist around three areas,\\nscope, schedule, and communication.\\nWhether someone is an introvert or an extrovert,\\nand no matter what specific skills\\na given employee possesses,\\neach team member needs to understand\\nhow these three areas affect them\\nand how their approach in turn affects those areas\\nand others involved in the process as well.\\n\\nLet's start with scope.\\nEvery project must have clearly defined goals\\nand clearly defined deliverables.\\nThose goals and deliverables need to be communicated\\nto each of your team members\\nand narrowed to area of responsibility.\\nA designer, for example, should have this area\\nof responsibility clearly outlined in their job description.\\nIt should say something like designer\\nwill execute design solutions for various projects\\nand clients within determined project scope.\\nThis creates an expectation and encourages a conversation\\nto help provide clarity if needed.\\n\\nThe next area is schedule.\\nSchedule and scope are the two areas where,\\nover time, the creative typically receives the most heat.\\nI've been in countless kickoff meetings\\nwhere one of the client's main concerns\\nis our ability to deliver on time and within scope,\\nbecause the client's past agencies\\nhave not been able to do that.\\nThere could be many factors to why that may have happened,\\nbut I want to take that out of the equation\\nwhere my agency is concerned.\\nSo we make sure all team members know that schedule\\nis just as key an aspect of our process\\nas our creative solutions are.\\n\\nBeing able to stay on schedule starts all the way back\\nwhen making hiring decisions.\\nWe want people who can execute beautifully of course,\\nbut we also must realize that we are serving clients,\\nand part of that service is an on time delivery.\\nIn my company, all the job descriptions\\ncontain a line about scope,\\nand we also specify that each team member\\nmust have an ability to meet deadlines\\nwith a high attention to detail.\\nI want to set this expectation right up front.\\nThese same points are emphasized\\nat each project kickoff and then again\\nwhen we review the project once it's completed.\\n\\nIf there is an issue, it becomes a point to cover\\nat the employee's next performance review.\\nFinally, the last area is the need for great communication.\\nThis is a broad term,\\nbut when I'm talking about communication,\\nit's from the standpoint of a project.\\nIt's important for the project manager and all team members\\nto be able to consistently and respectfully ask questions,\\nvoice concerns, and share ideas\\nin a consistent way about the specific project.\\nThis means communication in person, in emails,\\nand in your project management software.\\nConsistent communication will eliminate 90%\\nof your project issues,\\nbut this only happens if the expectation is set,\\nis appropriately modeled,\\nand is done in a consistent and safe environment.\\n\\nIf you share the project scope and schedule well,\\nhave regular check-ins, and encourage dialogue,\\nyour communication should be solid.\\nWhen you start there,\\nyou'll be in good

get right on it.\\\"\\nWe started doing that,\\nand everything worked beautifully.\\nYou may look at this and think, how annoying,\\nbut I suggest that you take a deep breath\\nand try to get some perspective.\\n\\nThis was a huge client\\nand also a client we loved working with,\\nso this was a situation we really wanted to figure out.\\nI understood that the client was extremely busy,\\nand

your typical process or recommended timeline.\\nWe then ask one final question,\\nhave you ever used project management software before?\\nThis is a key question.\\nIt will tell you how much education you need\\nto provide to your client about this platform.\\nRemember, they are busy too,\\nand they do not want to add an extra step.\\nSo choose your platform wisely.\\n\\nWe sign our clients up for our project management software\\nand then offer to walk them through how it works.\\nAt various points during the project,\\nwe offer any assistance they may need\\nto be as comfortable as possible with the platform.\\nWe do this even with clients who are familiar\\nwith what we use because everyone can use programs\\nlike this a bit differently.\\nWe want to help avoid any confusion earlier

assess how much the client\\nwill actually use the project management software\\nand plan for alternatives if necessary.\\nSome of our clients have said from the very beginning,\\nI will never go on this platform,\\nso please email me, video call me, et cetera.\\n\\nKnowing this upfront means you\\ncan adjust accordingly from the start.\\nWhen this happens, we accommodate the client.\\nBut we

are many types of clients who need\\nto be mindful when project managing.\\nFor most of us, if a client relationship is too difficult,\\nyou can move on if necessary.\\nBut often, there has been an enormous amount of blood,\\nsweat and tears to acquire the project.\\nSo walking away is not really the ideal option.\\nWhat if you work internally?\\nYou don't want to feel stuck with a difficult situation,\\nbut you can't walk away either.\\nThe good news is that a solid project management plan\\nand asking lots of directive questions\\ncan help you get through projects more efficiently\\nand often shift the process more and more\\ninto a positive experience.\\n\\nSo lets talk about two client types\\nthat we encounter fairly frequently.\\nThe first one is what we call an asker.\\nAn asker is a client that initially comes off\\nvery interested in the details, learning the process\\nand asking a lot of questions.\\nNow asking is not a bad thing, but ideally, at some point,\\nyou want your client to trust you and the process.\\nThis is why you asking as many upfront questions\\nreally can serve you.\\nIn other words, by getting as much detail as possible\\nabout scoping the project, budget concerns, ideal timelines,\\nthe approval process and communication styles.\\n\\nYou can minimize an askers questions.\\nBy having this detailed plan,\\nyou gather information directly from the clients mouth\\nthat you can in return use in response to questions\\nand help explain why you made certain choices\\nin the project plan.\\nThis reassures this type of client that you are listening\\nto their needs and you have incorporated them into the plan.\\nMake sure you listen to an asker client\\nand take note of any steps of the process\\nor forms of communication they seem to have\\nthe most concern or interest in.\\nFor example, we have a client\\nthat is especially concerned about timeliness.\\n\\nHe never asks about the budget.\\nHe just wants to know if we are on schedule.\\nThat is a valuable factor for him.\\nSo we build into our project management flow a weekly email\\nor phone call to go over the schedule.\\nSo we build into our project management flow a weekly email\\nor phone call to go over the schedule.\\nWe let them know we're on time\\nor a few days behind and we go over any roadblocks\\nand then outline the plans deliver.\\nWe also use that space for any additional questions\\nthat you've asked and we take the time\\nto build that relationship.\\nThat is reduced our questions to a normal amount.\\n\\nThe other client type is a taker.\\nThey sometimes can seem similar to the asker\\nbecause they have some of the same initial needs.\\nHowever, there is one key difference.\\nTakers ask a lot of questions\\nand then tend to move the project scope in some way.\\nI believe this is most often subconscious on their part.\\nIt might be a way of handling things modeled for them\\nby some old school perspective that we just need\\nto do whatever we're asked to do.\\nTakers often are really concerned\\nin the beginning of our budget, scope and timeline\\nand they seemly can change or try to change them on a whim.\\n\\nThis is also called project creep.\\nWhen this takes place, those initial questions\\nand answers and plan you provided are your best friend.\\nThat information is your advent\\nfor creating a legal case about why you need\\nto change the budget or push back in some way.\\nYou can use your signed off project scope\\nand your previously outlined process\\nas the foundation for managing the taker.\\nWhen you realize a client's a taker,\\nwe try to identify the areas they most tend to push us on.\\nAnd we make sure we address those as regularly as possible.\\nWe make sure we're ready to share with them what needs\\nto happen for that new option to take place.\\n\\nWhether it will add more time to the schedule,\\ncost more money or just can't happen in this version.\\nThe key is to be ready to respond\\nin a way that they will hear you.\\nI want to stress with you this is not\\nabout being negative or manipulative.\\nIt's really about following the defined process\\nthat reduce stress for both you and your clients.\\nThis will increase your profitability\\nand improve client relationships.\\nRemember too, all these situations should be handled\\nwith respect and calmness whenever possible.\\nAnd this is much easier to do\\nwhen you have a clearly laid out process,\\nan option on how to handle challenges when they arise.\\n\\nWith both askers and takers,\\nyou also have to remember that there is a limit.\\nAlthough we are all in the service business,\\nat some point, you may need to decide\\nif this is a healthy or unhealthy client.\\nDon't be afraid to speak up and be honest.\\nMany times a simple change of attitude, new questions\\nor tweaked steps can make all the difference.\\nSo be open to change but also know when enough is enough.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5028691\",\"duration\":209,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Structured and

structured client.\\nThis client has a defined process for communication,\\nand approval, and often has a project manager\\nthat is helping the job go through the paces\\non their side of the

understand your client's process, the better.\\nThat doesn't mean that you agree to your client's ideas\\nabout how the process should go.\\nYou still need to stand firm,\\nand incorporate the steps you know will lead to success.\\nBut with this client, we simply added one more step\\nthat not only helped us get the project approved smoothly,\\nit also ingrained us deeply into an organization\\nwe will work with for years to come.\\n\\nAnother aspect of this is the human-personal side.\\nThe client's project manager was concerned\\nfrom past experience that agencies\\nwould not want to deal with,\\nor accommodate their approval process.\\nThere will be times that a client's process\\nmay not be something you are comfortable with,\\nor want to deal with.\\nBut we decided to concentrate\\non the relationship with the client's project lead,\\nwhich enabled us to discover\\nthat the first round of approvals\\nwas really more of a presentation\\nto allow the board to feel part of the process.\\nWe also learned that in the past,\\npresentations given by the internal team\\ndidn't go as well as they could have.\\n\\nSo making us a part of this presentation\\nworked out for everyone in the long run.\\nWe were able to ask questions, listen,\\nand modify our plan to better accommodate their needs.\\nWith an unstructured client, there are pros and cons.\\nIt's great when they don't have their own process\\nand you take the time to provide the tools\\nand the guidance necessary to get the project moving.\\nYou have the framework, and can act as the guide.\\nBut the downside of this type of client\\nis when they are adverse or ambivalent\\nto the need for structure.\\nUnstructured clients respond when they want,\\nchange things whenever, forget about conversations\\nand project details, and the list can go on.\\n\\nThis is when a project management plan\\nand process really saves you.\\nYour plan helps guide you through the project,\\nand identify key areas of difficulty.\\nThen, if you do another project with this company,\\nyou'll be prepared.\\nYou can plan for it, charge extra if necessary,\\nand help educate the client.\\nIt also helps you

phenomenon\\nwhich happens when a learner receives, stores,\\nand retrieves information.\\nCognitivism was built upon the principles of behaviorism\\nbut focused less on stimulating observable behaviors\\nand more on how external mental models could be transferred\\nto the learner's mind.\\nWe apply this theory when we want people\\nto learn an organized set of facts and figures,\\nfor example, the rules and regulations\\ncontained in an employee handbook.\\n\\nConstructivism took cognitivism one step further\\nby asserting that people actively construct knowledge\\nin their own minds through problem-solving,\\nexperiential learning, and social learning.\\nIn this theory, learners are at the center\\nof the learning process and learn\\nby activating their own prior knowledge\\nand personal experience and looking at new information\\ncontextually and relative to their social environments\\nand interactions.\\nIn this way, learning happens as new knowledge\\nand

modern day,\\nelearning is pretty much a standard\\nfor any organized learning experience.\\nThe reality we face as instruction designers,\\neducational producers, learning experience managers,\\nwhatever you want to call us,\\nis that many collaborators on a project,\\nthere's stake holders, subject matter experts,\\nand decision makers, generally don't understand\\nwhat an instructional designer does\\nor the complicated nature of an elearning production,\\nand rightfully so.\\n\\nThat's not their role.\\nBut it's up to us to inform them what's involved,\\nhow long it will take, how much it will cost,\\nand the details of the learning experience.\\nAnd a key part of that is the elearning storyboard.\\nI love storyboarding.\\nI love how you get a script and you pull it apart,\\nthink through the visuals that might show on screen\\nor the activities and the experience\\nthe learners might have.\\nBut the reality is, storyboarding is simply\\na communication tool, it's as simple as that.\\n\\nIt will define how the content will be presented\\nand how the learners will engage with it.\\nTo better understand storyboarding\\nin the context of elearning design,\\nlet's first discuss where storyboarding came from.\\nLet's go back in time for a second.\\nHistorically, storyboarding is defined\\nas a series of drawings or pictures\\nthat show the changes of a scene and action\\nof a movie or television show.\\nStoryboards originated in the motion picture industry\\nto help directors and cinematographers\\npre-visualize a film's scenes and sequence.\\n\\nWe think the first known use of storyboards\\nappeared in silent films in the early 1900s.\\nHowever, Christopher Finch in the Art of Walt Disney\\ncredits Disney animator Webb Smith\\nwith being the first to arrange a series of drawings\\nin sequence to tell a story,\\nthus creating the first storyboard as we know it today.\\nIn elearning development however, a storyboard looks\\na bit less like a cartoon panel\\nand more like a series of columns and rows\\nrepresenting the text, visuals, and actions\\nof a learning experience.\\n\\nIt's your key to establishing a course's narrative flow,\\ndefining the what, where, how, and why.\\nIn elearning design, we want to strive to show\\nmore than we tell, and a storyboard will define\\nwhat you will say and show on screen.\\nIt should outline specific visual elements\\nor any associated text.\\nA storyboard will also help you define\\nwhere the user will go next in every screen of the course.\\n\\nIt'll help you think through your branching logic.\\nYou need to be thinking at all times,\\nwhat is going to lead where and why?\\nAnd that why is so very important.\\nWhy should I show this on screen before that?\\nWhy do I want the text to appear this way versus that?\\nIn your storyboard design and development,\\nalways think beyond the how to the why.\\nThink of an elearning storyboard as a roadmap\\nthat guides all involved through each aspect\\nof an elearning course design.\\nIt's truly an essential document\\nin an instructional designer's toolkit\\nbecause it outlines what a graphic designer\\nwill create, what a narrator will say,\\nand the interactions the programmer will produce.\\n\\nThey're essential in giving form to your elearning vision.\\nRemember, storyboarding is a communication tool\\nto keep everyone in the project on the same page\\nand help yourself and your project team\\nunderstand what you'll be showing,\\nwhere you're taking the learners, and why it's

practical solutions\\nto complex problems.\\n\\nHe said the beauty of storyboarding\\nis that ideas from an entire team are harnessed.\\nI love this quote.\\nIt says it perfectly.\\nIt's all about getting your ideas down on paper,\\nfinding creative solutions to help people learn,\\nand gathering feedback and input from your team.\\nThat's what this course is all about.\\nStoryboards help us be better communicators.\\nAt any part of the project you can reference the storyboard\\nfor stakeholder or subject-matter expert approval.\\nOne of the most important aspects\\nof the storyboarding process on any project\\nis that you and your team can identify errors\\nand keep a project from going off track at an early stage.\\n\\nStoryboards reduce scope creep.\\nScope creep occurs when a project grows\\nin a continuous, seemingly uncontrolled pattern.\\nThis has happened to all of us, right?\\nThis is happening on your projects,\\nreference the storyboard as a way to discuss\\nbringing the project back to a manageable place.\\nStoryboards reveal if a concept works,\\nand they help a designer think\\nthrough complex interactions and animations.\\nDeveloping a storyboard can also help your employer,\\nclient, or any team member on a project\\nidentify if additional budget or resources are needed.\\n\\nIt's also a way to visually share your vision\\nfor an elearning experience.\\nKeep this in mind.\\nYour brain processes visuals 60 times faster\\nthan it does text.\\nThink about that for a second.\\nPeople are wired to process visuals.\\nIt's in our nature.\\nTo help illustrate this,\\nlet me show you a quick example.\\nHere's a description.\\nThere are 24 dots, six in a row and four in a column.\\nThe dot in the middle-right section\\nis different than the rest.\\n\\nHere's the visual.\\nBetter, right?\\nVisuals help us see and nail home the point\\nin a way that's stickier than text.\\nWe should always be thinking about showing versus telling\\nin elearning design and in our storyboards.\\nThink of your storyboard like a blueprint\\nto assure that custom learning design and development\\nstays on track and on budget.\\nSo storyboarding is your visual analysis\\nof an elearning project.\\nIt's a time to iron out many of the initial issues\\nbefore they become big problems\\nwhen you go into development.\\n\\nThey'll make your design\\nand development process more efficient,\\nand they can not only help illustrate your ideas\\nbut also deliver engaging and visually rich\\nelearning experiences to your

[Instructor] Once you have a solid understanding\\nof the business needs, and your target audience,\\nyou'll then need to translate them\\nto learning goals and performance objectives.\\nIt was the French writer and poet,\\nAntoine de Saint-Exupery that said,\\n\\\"A goal without a plan is just a wish.\\\"\\nSo goals are important, but what are they\\nand how do they differ from an objective?\\nThere are a few different ways\\nto think about goals and objectives,\\nbut here's how I see it.\\nA course goal indicates a broad learning outcome\\nstudents will acquire at the end of a course.\\n\\nSo imagine you're mapping a trip to a new location.\\nAnd the blue navigational line that appears on your Maps app\\nwould represent your goal.\\nSo your course goal indicates this big picture,\\nor that long-term view that gets one\\nfrom destination A to destination B.\\nThis will provide you with a clear direction\\nof where you're heading\\nand help you track progress along the way.\\nAll project goals should be specific,\\nrealistic, and attainable.\\nSo specific, the goal should target\\na specific area for improvement.\\n\\nRealistic, it should state\\nwhat can realistically be achieved\\ngiven the available resources.\\nAnd attainable, one actually has to be able\\nto achieve the goal given the parameters of the course.\\nThis should provide you with a clear direction\\nof where you're heading, and again, help you track progress.\\nOne approach to writing learning goals\\nis to frame them as responses to the phrase,\\nupon completion of this course, the target audience will.\\nSo for the purposes of our Coaching for Managers course,\\nthat could read, upon completion of this course,\\nthe learner will demonstrate effective coaching techniques.\\n\\nAnd unlike a goal, a course objective\\nindicates a specific learning outcome,\\nwhich is derived from the course goal,\\nand there are usually multiple course objectives.\\nSo back to the Maps example.\\nThe objectives will be the road markers or the highway exits\\nyou would pass along the way.\\nAll course learning objectives should be measurable,\\nwhich means you can track if the learner\\nreached the objective or not,\\nwhich makes it easy to observe\\nwhen a learner fails or succeeds.\\nAnd note that when all course objectives are met,\\ntheir corresponding goal should also be achieved.\\n\\nAn approach to writing learning objectives\\nis to frame them as responses to the phrase,\\nupon completion of this course\\nthe target audience will be able to.\\nSo back to our example, we could say,\\nupon completion of this course,\\nmanagers will be able to provide actionable feedback\\nto their teams across various steps\\nin the development process.\\nThat's specific, and something we can measure.\\nAnother tactic is to link the objective to performance.\\nSo think about what the learner\\nis actually going to be able to do\\nwith the skills and information once the course is done.\\n\\nSo you could say, identify opportunities\\nto coach teammates, and learn the steps\\nto providing actionable feedback.\\nAnd another way to think about this is to ask,\\nwhat's the desired outcome at the end of the e-learning?\\nI learned this from a colleague and never forgot it.\\nWhatever learning experience you're crafting,\\nthink through what do want people thinking,\\nfeeling, and doing differently\\nas a result of this experience.\\nThe mindset, the emotion, and the action.\\nSo why talk about goals and objectives\\nin a storyboarding course?\\nWell, because this should be your North Star.\\n\\nIt should guide all the decisions you make\\nregarding course development and design.\\nDefining the goals and objectives\\nwill guide the whole storyboarding process.\\nPrioritize your goals and objectives along the way,\\nto keep thinking through your learner's needs,\\nas you design your courses\\nand before you get started in on your

increased when information is shared with others.\\n\\nSo to make online learning sticky, one must feel\\nlike they're learning from a human being, an actual person\\nthey can relate to, not a bot under the screen.\\nSo if there's voiceover and someone else other than you\\nis going to deliver that script, make sure to coach them\\non a conversational and organic delivery.\\nThere's nothing

relevant content.\\nIf it can be said in less words, less text on screen,\\nor with less panels, do that.\\nThat's concise, right?\\nAnd make it visual.\\nOnline learners will remember your content\\nmore effectively if it paints a vivid picture.\\nSo instead of just telling them about an idea\\nor a concept with text, try to use imagery and graphics\\nto support your learning points whenever possible.\\n\\nA well-written elearning script has the power\\nto help someone transform and grow.\\nIt's so cool, I love that.\\nSo when you're writing or editing your scripts\\nremember,

the tool\\nthat is most comfortable for you to get your ideas out.\\n\\nWith that said, when selecting a tool\\nto design your slides or develop your boards,\\nthink about if you will be working on a team,\\nor taking on the project solo.\\nThis can guide your decisions moving forward.\\nIf you're working on a team,\\nGoogle Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides\\nto me are a no-brainer.\\nAnd maybe I'm biased here because this is what I mainly use,\\nbut the advantage is they allow to gather\\nreal-time feedback within the documents\\nusing the comments feature.\\nAnd if you're working

it.\\nBelieve it or not, we storyboard every live action\\ncourse here at LinkedIn Learning, and lynda.com in Excel.\\nThe advantage of PowerPoint though,\\nbesides the fact that it's a tool\\nyou might be used to using, is that you can upload\\nto articulate storyline with relative ease.\\nSo if that's your development tool of choice\\nthat would be a good call for you.\\nYou can export from Google Slides to PowerPoint,\\nbut some funky things happen to your text and graphics\\nsometimes when you do that.\\n\\nSo bake in time for some extra work\\nif you use Google Slides.\\nI actually

to be an Adobe Captivate user\\nto create storyboards with Adobe Captive Draft.\\nSo this is something you might want to look into,\\nor try out.\\nA final thing to consider\\nis what tools are your clients used to?\\nWhen I first started freelancing, I didn't know Articulate\\nvery well at all, but my main client's internal team\\nused it so I learned it in short order.\\n\\nSome companies will use proprietary applications as well.\\nJust consider, how are your SMEs\\ngetting the documents to you,\\nwhat applications they're using\\nand then choose appropriately.\\nRemember your storyboard

[Narrator] There are many different versions\\nof storyboards, storyboard templates out there.\\nJust Google it and you'll get a plethora of information.\\nFirst, let's note that every storyboard\\nshould contain some or all of the following information.\\nText based storyboards focus mainly on, well, text.\\nAnd they will have text written descriptions\\nof each asset or visual you'll see onscreen\\nand the audio to learner will hear.\\nText based boards are usually about Microsoft Word\\nor Google Docs in a table format\\nlike this one you see here.\\n\\nYou can see we start with the lesson title\\nto let everyone know what content\\nthe storyboard aligns with.\\nThere will usually be space for\\nthe screen number you're on so also drop\\nand hear the type of screen this is\\nsuch as a quiz or an activity.\\nThis column will give your developer any graphics notes\\nso if these are your visual instructions\\ndetailing what exactly the learner\\nwill be seeing on screen from a graphic perspective.\\nThis next column will contain the text onscreen,\\naligned with that visual.\\nIn this final column in our text based storyboards\\nwill contain any narration or audio script\\nif your e-learning has voiceover.\\n\\nNow as an instructional designer,\\nI think you should always be thinking visually\\nso even if you decide to use this template\\nI'd recommend still dropping in a visual\\nin the graphics note section for your developer.\\nHave them pull images from Google\\nor I just mock up some pen and paper sketches\\nlike this for my developers.\\nAnything you can use to help them\\nunderstand what vision you're trying\\nto get across will help make the collaboration\\nand the handoff more successful.\\nSo visual storyboards are usually built\\nin PowerPoint or Keynote\\nand this may sound obvious but they will\\nalways show what the learner's going to see onscreen.\\n\\nAnd I find that visual based storyboards\\nend up being closer to the final result\\nthan working in a table in a Word document.\\nHere's a template that I often use\\nif you're wanting to show more than you're telling\\nin your storyboards.\\nAnd this template is great if you have\\nan image heavy palette or if you have simple\\nto complex interactions that you need\\nto communicate to your\\nsubject matter experts and developers.\\nSo let's define some of these elements a bit further\\nand take a look at how they might make their way\\ninto this template.\\nI usually drop the project title area\\nin a screen title area at the top of a panel.\\n\\nI find this keeps everyone reviewing the boards\\non the same page and it avoids my own confusion too\\nwhen I have multiple storyboards and projects\\ngoing on at the same time.\\nThe screen number area is where you'll add\\na unique identifier for each screen\\nsuch as two of 20 for instance.\\nThis main section here is your area\\nto define the graphics or the visuals you envision.\\nThis is the visual of what the learner\\nwill see onscreen such as\\nan illustration, diagram or even a video.\\nAnd you can add in images of hand drawn thumbnails here,\\nscreen grabs of Google images\\nor often you're probably designing the slides as well.\\n\\nYou can drop those in as mock ups\\nor your close to final slides here.\\nIn align with that visual section,\\nyou'll also have a descriptor here\\nin the visual info section\\nwhere you can note any text onscreen\\nthat will appear with the visual.\\nYou could also describe any animations you'd like\\nto see here or any media files to hand off.\\nAgain, such as a PNG, a PSD or an Illustrator file.\\nSo the voiceover and audio section is where\\nyou would define your voiceover narration\\nor audio script.\\nYou can also add the name of a music file\\nyou'd like to play over the visuals onscreen\\nor something that's always fun to think through\\nis adding any sound effects in\\nbut don't overdo it with the sound effects though\\nas it can up the cheese factor a bit.\\n\\nOkay in the top right section of this template,\\nthe navigation area is where you can describe\\nany interactions that occur onscreen\\nor define where the user will go next\\nwhich could include a video, quiz or a scenario.\\nInteractions, this is the good stuff\\nin e-learning design.\\nInteractivity has proven to have a significant impact\\non the effectiveness of the learning and e-learning process.\\nSo when you say something is interactive\\nyou're basically defining the dialogue\\nbetween the learner and the tool\\nfrom which the learner will engage in the process.\\n\\nAnd ultimately, learn something new.\\nSo you could use the Nav area to describe\\nany branching that may occur as well.\\nBranching differs a bit from interactions\\nas it refers to navigating the whole system.\\nSo to simplify this, just think of the next\\nand back buttons as well as any result\\nof a user interaction.\\nSo for example, if a learner fails a knowledge check,\\nor clicks on a link, this would define\\nwhere they are taken.\\nSo you can see in this example\\nwe're on slide one and next up would be slide two.\\nAnd then the user would advance the screen.\\n\\nYou can drop that section in here if you'd like.\\nI think that looks pretty nice up there.\\nOkay, last but not least\\nwe have the space for any reviewer comments.\\nAs I mentioned, I asked my team\\nto just leave feedback via Google Comments\\non the slide.\\nBut if you're using PowerPoint or Keynote,\\nthis could be a great place to keep track\\nof all the comments and changes\\nthat need to be addressed.\\nSo I highly recommend you take these templates\\nand make them your own.\\nEvery project is going to be different\\nand I'm constantly taking templates\\nand adding new sections and tweaking them\\nto work for the needs of the project.\\nMost storyboards though will probably\\nhave a mix of both text and visual based storyboards\\nand my recommendation, just fully think through\\nyour project first with a pen and paper.\\n\\nJust get down and get to work, scratch it out.\\nThis will allow you to be kind of swift\\nand try new things and fail often\\nand that way you can learn from what's working\\nand what's not working.\\nThen pull in whatever template you're most\\ncomfortable using and continue refining\\nyour ideas there.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

content.\\nNotice the organization here in this slide design.\\nYou have the header at the top\\nsectioned off with a color box for contrast,\\nyou have a subhead in bold 24 point font.\\nAnd then another second level in 18 point,\\nand if you need to go another level down,\\nyou can use the bullet with 15 point.\\n\\nI do my best not to reach this third level bullet point\\nwith text based slides, but it's there if you need it.\\nThis is a clean and simple design and easy to read.\\nBut what if you needed more text on screen?\\nThis is a comparison slide of text\\nusing a two column layout.\\nNotice there's a potential here\\nto have a lot of text onscreen,\\nwhich you should generally try to avoid,\\nbut the fonts are sizes that would make you\\nneed to be concise with what you show.\\nThat's a systematized and purposeful, creative constraint.\\nOn a slide like this, keep your word count down\\nand support the text with narration whenever possible.\\n\\nAlong with hierarchy is color.\\nYou could spend a lifetime studying color theory,\\nit's so fascinating, but for our purposes\\nsimply think about using color to direct attention.\\nThis can help your elearning reduce boredom and passivity,\\nand improve attention, readability and comprehension.\\nSo take a look at this example\\nfor our coaching for managers scenario.\\nWhether it's art, design, or a slide,\\npeople will look at the brightest object on screen.\\nHere I like the layout, it has a balance to it\\nbut you can see nothing really stands out.\\n\\nAnd I think timely, actionable, and consistent\\nare the keywords here.\\nSo let's make that pop by turning the other words orange\\nwhich has been identified as a color\\nthat we could use in this palette.\\nAnd now take a minute to look at this screen.\\nThe eye is directed to those keywords\\nin a clean, simple format.\\nI like that, slightly less opaque\\nthan the orange on the main text.\\nAnd reduce the brightness of the white here on that text\\nto send it back a bit.\\nNow we have achieved a nice balance of hierarchy and color\\nto guide the learner's attention\\nfrom top left to bottom right,\\nwhich is how learners read in the west.\\n\\nLet's move on to a sub-note of color, which is contrast.\\nThink contrast at all times.\\nDark backgrounds require a light text,\\nand light backgrounds require dark text.\\nThis will create the optimal visual experience\\nfor your audience.\\nHere is an example of a slide using color, hierarchy,\\nand contrast to guide the learner's eye from the text\\nto a video or image that will support\\nthis section's learning goals.\\nAnother important part of instructional design\\nis the use and layout of your visual elements.\\n\\nSo how you design your screen tells your learners\\nwhere to look and what's most important.\\nRemember you want the information on screen\\nto support the learning objectives of the course.\\nLet's take a look at this example,\\nI've seen stuff like this on storyboards\\nand it's like, what is happening here?\\nThe screen is trying to show ambulance aids\\nthat they should stand behind a moving vehicle.\\nBut the visual hierarchy here is not doing that justice.\\nSometimes the client might ask you to shake things up a bit,\\nor change the colors, or add in new graphics,\\nrefrain from that, keep it simple.\\n\\nThat can actually have a negative impact\\non how learners process the information.\\nHere's how I would redesign this.\\nRemove the extraneous items, like the bullhorn.\\nChange the background from that bright yellow,\\nremember light objects on dark backgrounds for contrast.\\nResize the guy, so he's at a more normal size.\\nAlways be careful when showing\\nwhat not to do in your e-learnings.\\nThe reality is, people will only remember a small percentage\\nof what they see and hear in your course,\\nso show the positive example,\\nin case that's the only thing\\nthey remember 10 weeks from now.\\n\\nAnd when you place graphics on screen,\\nyou can't assume that the learner\\nautomatically understands what they mean.\\nSo to guide the learner's understanding here,\\nI think we need a bit more information\\nso I added in a text box.\\nNotice the slight orange outline,\\nand the subtle drop shadow on the back of the text box\\nto make it pop.\\nI like to keep the navigation indicators simple\\nand I usually try to avoid\\nhaving large, obnoxious previous and next buttons\\nat the bottom of my screens.\\nSo now this has a nice use of hierarchy, color,\\nlayout and navigation.\\n\\nThere's simple graphics, yes,\\nbut they're very easy to follow.\\nSo you don't need to be a professional designer,\\nhowever to craft and effective elearning course,\\nit's really important to understand the basics of design.\\nWe've just scratched the surface here,\\nthere are numerous courses here for you to learn more.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:803863\",\"duration\":249,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Storyboarding example: Intro and

to do is figure out\\nthe visual style we're going for here.\\nAnd so, one thing I'll do sometimes\\nis start with a template design\\nthat I think is going to work well.\\nThe Google Slides templates are free\\nand have actually gotten quite good these days.\\nSo, we can use it as a starting point here,\\nand then adapt it to the course instruction.\\n\\nThis works if you don't have a graphic

template.\\nI created this in Google Slides,\\nand it can be adapted to PowerPoint very easily.\\nA version of this template is where I start\\nmost of my projects because it allows\\nfor simple to

add the text on screen for the intro slide here.\\nI like to do this so there's no confusion from what's\\nin the script to what's getting translated into visuals.\\nOK, so now, let's add the header slide\\nin that I designed on the side here.\\nNotice we're keeping it simple,\\nand we have a Start button to guide people in.\\n\\nWe'll need some navigation information here\\nfor our developer, so let's add that in, as well.\\nWe could say once the user is ready,\\nthey'll click the Start button to begin.\\nThen could add click Start to advance to the next slide.\\nPretty simple.\\nThen, regarding the visual info and media,\\nthis is the starter slide.\\nSo, I'll just let the developer know\\nit was designed in Google Slides.\\nBut I'd like to have a little bit\\nof fun here, so I'm leaving this note:\\nLet's have a light, subtle highlight\\naround the Start button, fading in and out\\nat an even pace, calling learners to dive in.\\n\\nIt's important to note here that certain things\\nare necessary to learning objectives\\nand other things are more for visual engagement.\\nThis would be a nice to have.\\nOK, on to the next panel.\\nLet's copy and paste the script\\ninto the description section.\\nNow, let's go out and snag\\nthe introduction slide I designed.\\nI usually just take screen grabs\\nof the designs and paste them in here.\\nAnd as you can see, this design is clean,\\nit's modern, it clearly articulates the section,\\nduration, and key topics using\\ntypographic hierarchy, as well as color.\\n\\nYou'll see we have a study guide\\nto download out here, as well.\\nAnd then the navigation to begin the lesson\\nis nice and clear, with a slight drop shadow.\\nThere's a solid hierarchy of information\\nguiding the learner along.\\nAnd let's be clear on what text\\nto show on screen and add that in.\\nAnd notice that will differ from the script section.\\nThen, again, add the navigation info.\\nWe'll say click Begin Lesson\\nto start to advance to the next slide.\\nAnd clicking Download study guide will auto-download a PDF.\\n\\nAdd any visual or media information\\nthat would be good to note here;\\nfor instance, the location of the study

up a notch here\\nand dive into storyboarding something a bit more complex,\\nlike an animation.\\nAdding in animations are a great way\\nto keep your learners engaged.\\nSo we create learning experiences for busy people.\\nThe fact is that the adult learners\\nviewing our courses usually are strapped for time,\\nbut they're also looking for something\\nto improve their skillset\\nor refresh their knowledge of a concept.\\n\\nAnd adding in animations and interactions to your eLearning\\nhas the ability of increasing knowledge transfer\\nin a fast-paced learning environment.\\nSo let's storyboard an animation.\\nWe're still building out our Coaching for Managers course,\\nand this is the script we were given\\nfrom our subject matter expert.\\nFor the purposes of this movie,\\nlet's say we do not have a visual look and feel\\nmapped out yet and we'll be able to use a voiceover.\\nSo okay, take a moment to review this content.\\nFeel free to pause the video if you have to.\\n\\nSo do you have ideas about how you would storyboard this?\\nWhat template would you use to communicate your vision?\\nAfter reading through the script,\\nI decided that this template was the best option\\nfor this type of content, based on the fact that for me,\\nit's the most versatile template.\\nAnd I had an idea while reading the script\\nto animate a timeline graphic here,\\nand I thought that this would be the best way to communicate\\nmy vision to the reviewers and the developer.\\nSo this is an image I sketched up on the back of a napkin\\nin a coffee shop.\\n\\nIn this situation, we haven't quite figured out\\nthe visual look and feel.\\nSo in the spirit of being agile and sharing early and often,\\nthis was the quickest way to get this mocked up\\nand out for review.\\nAnd I love drawing and thinking through ideas visually\\nwith the hand before I take it to the screen.\\nIt's just a fast and a fun way to get thoughts out on paper.\\nSo take a look at our template and add in a lesson title\\nand the screen title at the top here.\\nWe'll call this Screen number three out of 25,\\nand now let's add in the text to the boards here\\nin the Voiceover/Audio section.\\n\\nNotice that I needed to tweak this section size a bit\\nto fit all of that text, and that's okay.\\nYou will constantly be tweaking sections\\nto fit your descriptions.\\nOkay, now let's add in the image I mocked up\\nbased off of our back of the napkin sketch\\ninto the storyboard template.\\nSo I think this gets my idea across fine.\\nI'm thinking a timeline graphic again\\nthat will advance kind of along this dotted line\\nfrom left to right\\nas the voiceover reads through each section.\\nAlso, I like how the image fits into this template nicely.\\nThis template is really made for visuals\\nand it's sized appropriately.\\n\\nNow that our visuals are in there,\\nlet's add in the navigation information here.\\nSo let's say the slide advances by user\\nand the next slide equals SBI scenario.\\nSo this indicates the user will click to advance\\nand that the next slide is going to be a deeper dive\\non that second graphic and text,\\nthe situation behavior impact scenario.\\nIn the Visual Information, this is where I would describe\\nthe animation for the reviewer or developer.\\nIf there are specific graphics or visuals you have in mind,\\nalways drag them down and leave the location at the top\\nfor the developers.\\n\\nSo in this case, I would grab these icon images\\nalong the dotted line and drop them in their location\\nand add that note here.\\nFor the description, let's say\\nstart with the people speaking\\nin the top right and left corners.\\nHave the dotted line and associated graphics\\nand text dissolve on from left to right\\nwhen mentioned in the voiceover.\\nSo looking at the visual,\\nwe can start to kind of see this come together.\\nAnd if we wanted to add a bit of interactivity here,\\nwe could have additional information appear,\\nmaybe as the user hovers over each circle or graphic.\\n\\nNow let's add in the exact text on screen to appear.\\nThis is important in a case like this\\nbecause all the developer would see at this point\\nis my chicken-scratch handwriting and this hand-drawn image.\\nSo notice I had to bump this section up a bit\\nto account for all of this text,\\nbut hopefully this paints the picture\\nfor the developer enough.\\nI always struggle with how much or how little\\nto write in cases like this,\\nbut I think my rule of thumb here\\nis to be as concise but clear as possible.\\nYou don't want to write a book here, but if needed,\\nyou could leave additional notes\\nin the Speaker Notes section of PowerPoint\\nor Google Slides and I might write something like\\nSee Speaker Notes section for more information\\nhere at the bottom.\\n\\nOkay, this is one way to storyboard an animation.\\nTake a look back at that script\\nand see if any ideas pop in your head\\nabout how you'd think through this differently.\\nWhich template would you use?\\nWhat would you include in the storyboards?\\nAnd how do you communicate that to a developer\\nor your subject

some kind\\nof a decision, and once a decision has been made,\\nthey then receive some kind of feedback on their choice\\nto either confirm their knowledge\\nor deliver additional points on the topic.\\nSo, if they click on a answer,\\nthere should be a corresponding action\\nto give them some feedback\\nor develop their knowledge further.\\nWhen you're crafting your scenario, keep it realistic.\\n\\nMake it about real-world situations over theory.\\nThink about, what are the core skills\\nthat they want to develop?\\nWhat real-world challenges do learners face\\nin their actual working environments?\\nIn keeping with our project theme of coaching for managers,\\nthe idea for this scenario is a real-world conversation\\nbetween a manager and their employee.\\nSo, in our hypothetical situation here,\\nwe didn't get much feedback from our\\nsubject matter expert on this.\\nThey basically just said, \\\"It would be great\\n\\\"to have some kind of a scenario here around communicating\\n\\\"with their employees.\\\"\\nThis will often happen when you're working\\nwith a subject matter expert on content development.\\n\\nThey don't know exactly what to say or

theory here, this is about action and response.\\nThis would effectively simulate a real encounter,\\nand the responses are probably responses\\nyou've heard before.\\nSo, that's our slide design and

mix.\\nAnd I usually just screen grab my slides\\nand drop them into the boards like this.\\nOkay, that's looking pretty good.\\nThere's no voiceover or audio in this section,\\nso we can put N/A here for not applicable.\\nIn the visual info and media section,\\nI'll add the location of the background image\\nin case my developer needs this.\\nI'll also note that this was designed in Google

second answer,\\nthey'll go to slide eight.\\nThese are the feedback slides,\\nand it also notes how the slide advances.\\nSo, in this case, the user clicks their answer,\\nradial plus submit.\\nThe

learner some additional and valuable information,\\nnot just sharing the correct answer.\\n\\nThink of time when you were taking a course\\nand you made a selection, and then you get the feedback\\nthat was like, that's incorrect, try again.\\nIt's kind of a bummer, right?\\nIt makes you feel like you're not getting it\\nor you're doing something wrong.\\nSo giving your learners here some additional content\\nwill just add educational value to the course,\\nand help your learners gain confidence.\\nSo here's the feedback we would add in for these answers.\\nTo keep this simple,

the way?\\nTry to understand their motivations,\\ntheir interests, and their constraints.\\nSo what's driving them,\\nand what's potentially holding them back?\\nDuring the meeting, much like how you go about\\nbuilding a course, a good meeting presentation\\nbegins with the big picture, lay the context.\\n\\nAnd then, narrow it down into the specifics.\\nMake sure to get to the why,\\nso before

forward.\\nIf you can't communicate the ideas\\nbehind your storyboard designs concisely,\\nthen you probably haven't done the upfront work properly.\\n\\nIronically, it takes time and preparation\\nto be clear and concise.\\nAnd use active listening to understand,\\nrespond to, and articulate your stakeholder's point of view.\\nSome sentence starters you can use here are,\\nin other words, or if I can summarize your position.\\nThese types of phrases will validate all assumptions\\nand verify that you understand the feedback.\\nAlso, ask lots of follow up questions,\\nsuch as, what do you currently like and dislike\\nabout the storyboards, the designs, or the course?\\nWhat information is not included that should be included?\\nAnd you can say, do you feel like this addresses\\nand will impact our shared learning goals?\\nAnother question I love to ask at the end of meetings is,\\nis there anything else I should know?\\nIt usually catches people a bit off-guard,\\nbut it opens up for them to talk about\\nanything that may have been simmering\\nin the back of their mind during your presentation,\\nor as you were reading through your

 \\n The cool thing about digital learning is  \\n that it often takes place where a worker does their work,  \\n for instance, a newly hired service technician  \\n demonstrating on-the-job competency  \\n by knocking items off a checklist  \\n or perhaps a software engineer posting a technical question  \\n on the company's social site.  \\n In either case, the learning is baked into the work,  \\n and that makes it more relevant and more valuable.  \\n And finally, digital learning jives  \\n with the way everyone learns today.  \\n When you need to learn something, where do you go first?  \\n My hunch is Google or YouTube.  \\n And it's not just adults.  \\n My nine-year-old spends a good chunk  \\n of her day learning digitally,  \\n in particular, developing reading and math skills.  \\n There are many, many benefits  \\n for including aspects of digital learning,  \\n extended reach, reduced costs,  \\n incorporating learning into the workplace, and many others.  \\n Which resonate most with you  \\n and the needs of your organization?

 \\n Tip two: break participants into small groups.  \\n Small group discussions and activities are great.  \\n They're often more intimate,  \\n they create some variety  \\n and the students learn from each other.  \\n Most virtual learning platforms  \\n have this functionality built in.  \\n If the one you're using doesn't, create a workaround.  \\n Tip three: regularly check in with participants.  \\n You don't have the luxury of having everyone  \\n in the same room,  \\n so you're going to have to check in with students  \\n a bit more than normal.  \\n Call them by name,  \\n ask them to turn on their webcam when speaking,  \\n encourage them to respond verbally or through the chat.  \\n If you want to check in with all students  \\n to see how well they're understanding things,  \\n offer up a poll.  \\n Tip four: include additional resources  \\n that complement the session  \\n that learners can check out on their own.  \\n This might be material from LinkedIn Learning,  \\n online modules, blog posts from leaders in the field.  \\n This will give you stuff to talk about  \\n during your next session.  \\n And tip five: keep sessions on the shorter side.  \\n The longest you want to go is 90 minutes.  \\n It's way better to have multiple sessions per week  \\n than one long honking one.  \\n Keeping them shorter will also make recording  \\n and uploading the sessions easier.  \\n We've covered a decent amount of ground there,  \\n so let's sum up.  \\n Virtual instruction is effective  \\n when students need immediate feedback  \\n and the chance to collaborate.  \\n When you design them, remember to:  \\n create activities that encourage participation,  \\n check in with students often  \\n and keep sessions on the shorter side.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319270\",\"duration\":181,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Technical tips and tools: Virtual instructor-led training\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_03_03_XR30_technical\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5488768,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] We want to deliver  \\n high quality Virtual Training  \\n and we want to look and sound good while doing it.  \\n To achieve these worthwhile goals,  \\n there are a few technical things  \\n concerning how we present ourselves  \\n and the tools we use that we need to know.  \\n Let me start with a few tips  \\n that will allow us to present ourselves  \\n in the best professional light.  \\n My first suggestion is to invest in a quality microphone,  \\n and of course run your session from a quiet room.  \\n Good headset mics aren't expensive,  \\n and will yield far better quality  \\n than the mic on your computer.  \\n They are also better at filtering out background noise,  \\n which you always want to minimize.  \\n Position your webcam so that you're looking up slightly  \\n when you look into it.  \\n This angle simulates eye contact  \\n and is more flattering as you'll have  \\n fewer shadows on your face.  \\n Also, make sure your face is well lit.  \\n Natural soft light is best,  \\n say from a window across the room.  \\n If that's not an option,  \\n place a lamp in front of you so as to illuminate your face  \\n and remove unflattering shadows.  \\n It'll take a few practice recordings to get your sound,  \\n camera angle, and lighting just right.  \\n But I'm confident that you'll quickly  \\n achieve a professional setup.  \\n Okay, now let's turn to tools.  \\n It's hard to do quality work without quality tools.  \\n Some of the more popular conferencing tools  \\n like Zoom and Google Meet are easy to use,  \\n but they're really built for meetings rather than training.  \\n But I get it, sometimes you got to use  \\n what the company tells you to.  \\n If you must use a platform that doesn't offer much  \\n in the way of training functionality,  \\n you're at least going to want to  \\n quizzing and polling application.  \\n For quizzing, I recommend Kahoot.  \\n A game based quizzing application,  \\n which participants have a lot of fun with.  \\n And for polling your participants, I recommend Slido.  \\n Both are low to no cost apps.  \\n Now, if you want to master the virtual training format,  \\n you're going to need a platform built for training.  \\n The two platforms I recommend are GoToWebinar and Webex.  \\n Both companies have been in the training space a long time,  \\n have robust features, as well as solid customer service.  \\n Whatever virtual platform you use,  \\n get intimate with all its functionality.  \\n Can you break participants into chat rooms?

 \\n Well, the first thing is to consult  \\n with at least two subject matter experts,  \\n meaning people that do that actual job.  \\n That's really important.  \\n Have the subject matter experts  \\n break the main task you're testing for,  \\n say a customer service technician  \\n properly greeting a customer, into sub-tasks:  \\n smiling, introducing yourself as a representative  \\n of the company, and so on.  \\n Once the subject matter experts have agreed  \\n on the sub-tasks,  \\n you as the instructional designer  \\n have a number of decisions to make.  \\n How many sub-tasks will you place in the checklist?

 \\n B, get out of the vehicle and apologize to the driver;  \\n and so on.  \\n After the learner makes a choice,  \\n they're given feedback on it.  \\n The feedback might be instructional,  \\n which is the \\\"Yes, you're right, and here's why\\\" type.  \\n Right on, now that you know the basics of scenarios,  \\n let me give you a few tips on getting started with them.  \\n I'll focus on e-learning  \\n since this is where they appear most.  \\n Ask your subject matter experts  \\n where workers tend to struggle on the job.  \\n Work with the subject matter experts  \\n to create scenarios that are true to life.  \\n This will take more development time,  \\n but the realism is worth it.  \\n If you're just getting started with scenarios, start small.  \\n Place a few scenario-based questions in an upcoming quiz.  \\n As you gain more experience,  \\n consider experimenting with longer scenarios  \\n that have multiple decision points.  \\n Grab your phone and capture the images, and possibly video,  \\n that you'll need to portray the scenario's environment.  \\n Whatever you capture is going to be way better  \\n and more realistic than anything  \\n a stock photo site can give, plus it's way more fun.  \\n The realism provided by scenarios  \\n make them an effective tool to assess your learner's skill.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319274\",\"duration\":149,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Assess knowledge through online tests\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_04_05_XR30_online_test\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about best practices in assessing knowledge via traditional tests.

A 2.5% sales increase is still pretty good.  \\n It works out to $150,000 per year for five stores.  \\n Good, right?  \\n Well, the chief financial officer might point out  \\n that we're using revenue for our calculation,  \\n not gross profit.  \\n Gross profit is revenue minus the cost of goods sold.  \\n Here's what happens when we use gross profit  \\n for our ROI calculation.  \\n Let's say the average gross profit  \\n at our retail stores is 35%.  \\n We can multiply this by our pilot revenue gain of $150,000  \\n to see a $52,500 annual gross profit gain.  \\n To calculate ROI,  \\n we subtract the $25,500 program cost from the $52,500 gain  \\n and then divide that number by the cost of the program.  \\n This yields 106% return on investment.  \\n Okay, all this math might make your head hurt a little,  \\n but it explains how executives and trainers  \\n often see things differently.  \\n A trainer might say,  \\n \\\"Hey, this new sales training program  \\n increased sales by $150,000.\\\"  \\n An executive might say,  \\n \\\"Well, according to my math, we only gained $27,000.\\\"  \\n Now, this was a pilot with five stores.  \\n Let's look at the projected ROI  \\n if we roll it out to all 100 stores in the chain.  \\n We'll take the $5,100 training cost per store  \\n and multiply that by 100 stores.  \\n Next, we'll multiply that $510,000 total cost  \\n by the 106% ROI to get an expected net gain of $540,600.  \\n Okay, now I know again, that's a lot of math,  \\n so I've put all the numbers for this example  \\n on the downloadable sample ROI calculation worksheet.  \\n You won't use the ROI model for every training program,  \\n but this example highlights a situation  \\n where it can be very helpful.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3072565\",\"duration\":191,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Brinkerhoff's Success Case Method\",\"fileName\":\"479801_en_US_01_03_2022Q2_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about the Success Case Method.

behavior, like that of animals,\\ncould be explained in terms of conditioning\\nwithout reference to thoughts or feelings.\\n\\nBasically, learning happened as a reaction\\nto external stimuli.\\nTouch a hot stove and you learn not to touch it again.\\nWhen you see a stop sign, you apply pressure\\nto your brake pedal.\\nWhen someone sneezes, you say gesundheit.\\nBehaviorism says that learning is the mastering\\nof predictable behaviors.\\nTherefore, the right instruction design will teach\\ndemonstrable skills that can be measured by observations.\\nWe apply this theory, for example, when we teach employees,\\nif you see something wrong, speak up.\\n\\nEventually, behaviorism was challenged\\nby a new generation of psychologists\\nwho argued that learning is a cognitive phenomenon\\nwhich happens when a learner receives, stores,\\nand retrieves information.\\nCognitivism was built upon the principles of behaviorism\\nbut focused less on stimulating observable behaviors\\nand more on how external mental models could be transferred\\nto the learner's mind.\\nWe apply this theory when we want people\\nto learn an organized set of facts and figures,\\nfor example, the rules and regulations\\ncontained in an employee handbook.\\n\\nConstructivism took cognitivism one step further\\nby asserting that people actively construct knowledge\\nin their own minds through problem-solving,\\nexperiential learning, and social learning.\\nIn this theory, learners are at the center\\nof the learning process and learn\\nby activating their own prior knowledge\\nand personal experience and looking at new information\\ncontextually and relative to their social environments\\nand interactions.\\nIn this way, learning happens as new knowledge\\nand experiences are adapted and integrated\\nwith a learner's existing mental models.\\n\\nConstructivism and various constructivist theories,\\nsuch as social constructivism, situated learning,\\nand

 \\n The cool thing about digital learning is  \\n that it often takes place where a worker does their work,  \\n for instance, a newly hired service technician  \\n demonstrating on-the-job competency  \\n by knocking items off a checklist  \\n or perhaps a software engineer posting a technical question  \\n on the company's social site.  \\n In either case, the learning is baked into the work,  \\n and that makes it more relevant and more valuable.  \\n And finally, digital learning jives  \\n with the way everyone learns today.  \\n When you need to learn something, where do you go first?  \\n My hunch is Google or YouTube.  \\n And it's not just adults.  \\n My nine-year-old spends a good chunk  \\n of her day learning digitally,  \\n in particular, developing reading and math skills.  \\n There are many, many benefits  \\n for including aspects of digital learning,  \\n extended reach, reduced costs,  \\n incorporating learning into the workplace, and many others.  \\n Which resonate most with you  \\n and the needs of your organization?

 \\n Tip two: break participants into small groups.  \\n Small group discussions and activities are great.  \\n They're often more intimate,  \\n they create some variety  \\n and the students learn from each other.  \\n Most virtual learning platforms  \\n have this functionality built in.  \\n If the one you're using doesn't, create a workaround.  \\n Tip three: regularly check in with participants.  \\n You don't have the luxury of having everyone  \\n in the same room,  \\n so you're going to have to check in with students  \\n a bit more than normal.  \\n Call them by name,  \\n ask them to turn on their webcam when speaking,  \\n encourage them to respond verbally or through the chat.  \\n If you want to check in with all students  \\n to see how well they're understanding things,  \\n offer up a poll.  \\n Tip four: include additional resources  \\n that complement the session  \\n that learners can check out on their own.  \\n This might be material from LinkedIn Learning,  \\n online modules, blog posts from leaders in the field.  \\n This will give you stuff to talk about  \\n during your next session.  \\n And tip five: keep sessions on the shorter side.  \\n The longest you want to go is 90 minutes.  \\n It's way better to have multiple sessions per week  \\n than one long honking one.  \\n Keeping them shorter will also make recording  \\n and uploading the sessions easier.  \\n We've covered a decent amount of ground there,  \\n so let's sum up.  \\n Virtual instruction is effective  \\n when students need immediate feedback  \\n and the chance to collaborate.  \\n When you design them, remember to:  \\n create activities that encourage participation,  \\n check in with students often  \\n and keep sessions on the shorter side.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319270\",\"duration\":181,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Technical tips and tools: Virtual instructor-led training\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_03_03_XR30_technical\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5488768,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] We want to deliver  \\n high quality Virtual Training  \\n and we want to look and sound good while doing it.  \\n To achieve these worthwhile goals,  \\n there are a few technical things  \\n concerning how we present ourselves  \\n and the tools we use that we need to know.  \\n Let me start with a few tips  \\n that will allow us to present ourselves  \\n in the best professional light.  \\n My first suggestion is to invest in a quality microphone,  \\n and of course run your session from a quiet room.  \\n Good headset mics aren't expensive,  \\n and will yield far better quality  \\n than the mic on your computer.  \\n They are also better at filtering out background noise,  \\n which you always want to minimize.  \\n Position your webcam so that you're looking up slightly  \\n when you look into it.  \\n This angle simulates eye contact  \\n and is more flattering as you'll have  \\n fewer shadows on your face.  \\n Also, make sure your face is well lit.  \\n Natural soft light is best,  \\n say from a window across the room.  \\n If that's not an option,  \\n place a lamp in front of you so as to illuminate your face  \\n and remove unflattering shadows.  \\n It'll take a few practice recordings to get your sound,  \\n camera angle, and lighting just right.  \\n But I'm confident that you'll quickly  \\n achieve a professional setup.  \\n Okay, now let's turn to tools.  \\n It's hard to do quality work without quality tools.  \\n Some of the more popular conferencing tools  \\n like Zoom and Google Meet are easy to use,  \\n but they're really built for meetings rather than training.  \\n But I get it, sometimes you got to use  \\n what the company tells you to.  \\n If you must use a platform that doesn't offer much  \\n in the way of training functionality,  \\n you're at least going to want to  \\n quizzing and polling application.  \\n For quizzing, I recommend Kahoot.  \\n A game based quizzing application,  \\n which participants have a lot of fun with.  \\n And for polling your participants, I recommend Slido.  \\n Both are low to no cost apps.  \\n Now, if you want to master the virtual training format,  \\n you're going to need a platform built for training.  \\n The two platforms I recommend are GoToWebinar and Webex.  \\n Both companies have been in the training space a long time,  \\n have robust features, as well as solid customer service.  \\n Whatever virtual platform you use,  \\n get intimate with all its functionality.  \\n Can you break participants into chat rooms?  \\n Can you offer quizzes and polls on the fly?  \\n Get into the software and play around,  \\n look under every nook and cranny.  \\n Research how creative people are using the platform.  \\n As you can tell, there's a decent amount of technology  \\n involved in virtual instruction.  \\n But mastering it comes down to two basic things.  \\n Setting up your audio and webcam  \\n so you look and sound your best,  \\n and getting to know your platform tools really well.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2320929\",\"duration\":172,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Development tips: Elearning\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_03_04_XR30_development\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Explore best practices and commonly used tools for building traditional elearning.

 \\n By assessing what your students actually learn.  \\n So let's go over some of the ways you can measure  \\n what your learners have learned.  \\n Okay, most of us are teaching students how to do work tasks,  \\n so one obvious way to measure what students learn  \\n is to see how well they perform those tasks on the job.  \\n A checklist is a popular way to do this.  \\n Let's say you create a video  \\n that shows warehouse specialists how to do specific tasks  \\n with the forklift.  \\n To assess how well they do those tasks,  \\n You create a checklist of tasks  \\n and have a supervisor administer it in the warehouse.  \\n A second way we can gauge our students' knowledge  \\n is to have them perform work tasks in an environment  \\n that's pretty close to the real work environment.  \\n This is called a simulation.  \\n For example, a roleplay,  \\n say one based on a selling situation  \\n that's performed by knowledgeable, engaged players  \\n is pretty darn close to the real thing.  \\n A third way you gauge knowledge is through scenarios.  \\n When you create a scenario,  \\n you describe a real-life work situation through text,  \\n images, video, and then you ask your student  \\n what they should do given that situation.  \\n For example, in a management fundamentals course,  \\n the setup might be, Jenny,  \\n who has always been a solid performer on your team  \\n has been late to work four out of the last five days.  \\n How should you approach her about that issue?  \\n You see scenarios all the time in e-learning.  \\n Last, you can gauge your students' knowledge  \\n through traditional tests.  \\n Even though a test is far removed from the work environment,  \\n it's still an efficient and effective way  \\n to assess what students have learned.  \\n Alright, to just sum this up,  \\n there are four ways you can assess the learner's knowledge.  \\n You can assess it through on-the-job tasks.  \\n You can assess it in an environment  \\n that's pretty close to the real work environment,  \\n we call this a simulation.  \\n You can assess it in a scenario.  \\n And finally, you can assess it through a traditional test.  \\n If you'd like to learn more about assessment,  \\n I strongly recommend Sharon Schrock  \\n and William Coscarelli's book  \\n \\\"Criterion-Referenced Test Development.\\\"  \\n It certainly shaped my thinking on the subject.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319273\",\"duration\":178,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Assess performance through on-the-job checklists\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_04_02_XR30_checklists\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about best practices for building on-the-job checklists that allow you to assess workers' skills.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5450253,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] The best way to assess  \\n how well a student can perform  \\n the work task we're teaching them  \\n is to have them perform it on the job.  \\n This is commonly done through on-the-job checklists.  \\n There are different ways you can form a checklist  \\n but for this discussion,  \\n we'll look at yes/no checklists,  \\n meaning the person you're testing  \\n either performed the task or they didn't.  \\n So, how do you create one?  \\n Well, the first thing is to consult  \\n with at least two subject matter experts,  \\n meaning people that do that actual job.  \\n That's really important.  \\n Have the subject matter experts  \\n break the main task you're testing for,  \\n say a customer service technician  \\n properly greeting a customer, into sub-tasks:  \\n smiling, introducing yourself as a representative  \\n of the company, and so on.  \\n Once the subject matter experts have agreed  \\n on the sub-tasks,  \\n you as the instructional designer  \\n have a number of decisions to make.  \\n How many sub-tasks will you place in the checklist?  \\n All of them or maybe just the core ones  \\n that make up the main task?  \\n Of course, shorter checklists are easier to administer.  \\n What's a passing score?  \\n Does the learner need to complete all of the tasks  \\n or can they miss a few?  \\n How will the checklists be administered?  \\n Paper and pen or perhaps access  \\n through the learning management system on a mobile device.  \\n How will students' performance on the checklist be tracked?  \\n On a spreadsheet of some kind?  \\n I know that's a lot to think about  \\n but if you have a clear understanding of the tasks  \\n and what'll work at your company,  \\n I'm confident that it won't take a ton of effort  \\n to create a quality checklist.  \\n On-the-job checklists  \\n are usually administered by supervisors.  \\n So after you determine what's on the checklist  \\n and how it will be administered,  \\n you'll need to gain the support of supervisors.  \\n Meet with them well before you plan  \\n to have the checklists administered.  \\n Tell the supervisors why you're doing what you're doing.  \\n Explain why their support is crucial.  \\n Tell them what they need to do to administer the checklist  \\n and whom to contact if they have questions.  \\n Follow up your meeting with written instructions.  \\n If you don't win over the supervisors,  \\n the ones who are doing the actual assessing,  \\n your checklists will fail.  \\n Either they'll be ignored  \\n or supervisors will just go through the motions  \\n and check yes, yes, yes all the way down.  \\n A student's performance on a checklist  \\n can have weighty consequences,  \\n so you'll need to have a plan for tracking.  \\n If you house the checklists in a learning management system,  \\n the tracking will be done for you.  \\n If you use printable checklists,  \\n you might have the supervisor take a picture  \\n of the checklist after it's been administered  \\n and upload it to an appropriate place.  \\n Checklists are a wonderful way  \\n to assess the real world skills you're teaching  \\n in your digital program.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2324134\",\"duration\":142,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Assess performance through simulations\",\"fileName\":\"2976142_04_03_XR30_simulations\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about best practices for building digital simulations and scenarios.

[Instructor] Just because everyone else is doing it,\\ndoesn't mean it's right for you.\\nThere are a lot of training programs out there\\nthat are moving from an in-person to an online space,\\nso before you jump on the Elearning bandwagon,\\nlet's explore if it's a good fit for you.\\nBefore we cover how to adapt and migrate\\nan in-person training to an Elearning one,\\nlet's discuss similarities and differences\\nto give you some perspective\\nof what Elearning is and what it is not.\\nRegardless of the delivering method,\\nin-person or online, some elements\\nare the same in any type of training.\\n\\nIn both formats, we will have learning\\nobjectives, the goals of the training\\nand what we want the learners to take away.\\nTraining content, elements of a training,\\nsuch as text, graphics, quizzes, exercise, and tests.\\nInformation that is presented to the learners.\\nThis can be in the form of lectures or presentations.\\nAt the core, these type of trainings are very similar\\nbut that doesn't mean you can just throw up\\nyour in-person training materials on a website.\\nThere are many other things to consider.\\n\\nSo now, I wanna highlight some differences.\\nThe first is logistics and cost.\\nIn-person learning usually requires\\nthe training and the participants\\nto be in the same place at the same time.\\nThe company usually covered these accommodations\\nand travel expenses, not to mention\\nthe cost for scheduling and coordinating.\\nThis can all get quite expensive.\\nOn the other hand, online learning expenses can happen\\non the front end, whether you are creating the content\\nor buying participant access in the form of seats.\\n\\nOtherwise, the costs are pretty\\nminimal to keep the training running.\\nSo, when you do the head cost per learner,\\nyou're likely to spend much more in-person than online.\\nThe second difference is focus.\\nIn-person training is trainer-centric.\\nLearners focus on the trainer\\nand the information as it's presented.\\nThere's no opportunity for the learner\\nto stop and review what they've learned\\nunless they stop the instructor.\\nOn the other hand, online learning is learner-centric.\\n\\nThe online learning format is self-paced\\nand gives learners a lot of control\\nover their own learning experience.\\nAnd the third difference is when\\nand where the learning happens.\\nIn-person training sessions are usually confined\\nto a physical classroom and hence, offer very little\\nflexibility to learners in terms of place and time.\\nOnline learning provides access to learning experiences\\non demand, which means the learner can access it any time.\\nLet's look at the core benefits of Elearning.\\n\\nElearning provides convenience.\\nLearners can usually jump into a training platform\\nanywhere they can get online.\\nIt provides access.\\nLearners, wherever they are, can take the training program.\\nAnd it provides personalization.\\nLearners can be self-paced and adapt\\ntheir content to their own learning style.\\nAnd to that end, the common types\\nof Elearning training programs are, first,\\nskill-based instruction with outcome expectations.\\nThese programs are focused on procedures\\nand how to do something, for example, compliance training.\\n\\nSecond, information delivery\\nwith no performance expectations.\\nThese programs are more information sharing\\nand awareness building focused.\\nAnd third, problem-solving guidelines.\\nThese are the most challenging programs to design\\nbecause you are teaching principles or guidelines.\\nFor example, training a manager\\non how to have difficult conversations.\\nIf your training falls under one of these categories, great.\\nYou can move on to deeper consideration.\\nAnd if it doesn't, you can still play\\nwith the idea of creating an Elearning training program.\\n\\nEither way, you will want to look\\nat the nature of your content, next.\\nOnce you have determined if your training content\\nis a good fit for Elearning, you need to consider\\nwhich delivery method is best for the type of content.\\nThere are two types of delivery methods,\\nasynchronous and synchronous.\\nThe first is asynchronous,\\nwhich is characterized as anytime, anywhere.\\nThis is usually the choice method\\nfor online learning because of its benefits.\\nFor one, asynchronous provides flexibility for the learner\\nto come into the instruction on their own time.\\n\\nAlso, this option allows you to build the training\\ncontent ahead of time and then not have to touch it\\nuntil you have an update or two.\\nThe second delivery method is synchronous learning.\\nThis is characterized as live learning\\nand usually occurs over a set period of time.\\nWhile this does require the learner\\nto be available at specific times,\\nwhich can be seen as a negative,\\nit can help the learner stay on track\\nwith a dedicated training time.\\nIt also allows for learners to interact in real time,\\nwhich can help emulate the classroom experience.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you are sequencing the training,\\nyou can also build the content as you go,\\nso you don't need to have everything done upfront.\\nSo, in-person training versus online training.\\nAsynchronous versus synchronous.\\nYou have many options that come with unique benefits.\\nWhat's important, however, is keeping\\nyour objectives and learners in mind.\\nSo, the next time you're designing a training program,\\nconsider all of your options and ask,\\nwhat best meets the needs of my learners?\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:787908\",\"duration\":222,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Developing your

model has been used in various learning spaces\\nfrom higher ed to corporate training\\nbecause it is applicable to any environment, audience,\\nand topic.\\n\\nADDIE breaks down the instructional content development\\nprocess into five phases: analysis, design,\\ndevelopment, implementation, and evaluation.\\nThe five phases can guide your decision-making process\\nand offer a structure to create thoughtful\\nand comprehensive instruction.\\nIt is not only crucial to focus on each phase,\\nbut also to understand how each phase can impact\\nthe overall development and effectiveness of the process.\\nLet's dive into each phase in a little bit more detail.\\n\\nIn the analysis phase, organizational needs\\nand existing knowledge gaps are identified.\\nThis information is used to develop instructional goals\\nfor the training.\\nArticulating the instructional goals\\nwithin the first stage enables you\\nto create a vision for the entire program.\\nAs we move forward in building a learning experience,\\nwe continue to refer back to those goals\\nto make sure we're on track.\\nHaving a goal is great, but if a training isn't designed\\nwith a learner in mind, you may never be able\\nto reach that goal, so understanding\\nthe learner's perspective is critical\\nfor a successful training program.\\n\\nTo determine this, ask, what are the areas\\nof the subject that the learner typically struggles with?\\nWhat is a common level of prior knowledge\\nthe learner has when entering the training?\\nWhat tone and style is appropriate\\nfor the learner demographic?\\nWith all these factors in mind,\\nwe move on to the design phase.\\nThe design phase shapes your teaching approach\\nand the training program organization,\\nlearning outcomes, assessment, and materials.\\n\\nIt is during this phase you address such questions as,\\nwhat methodology will you use?\\nHow should the content be organized\\nto optimize the learning experience?\\nWhat are the learner outcomes\\nand the accompanying assessments?\\nWhat materials or resources will be used in the instruction?\\nIn the next phase, development, you put your plan to action.\\nNow is the time to create all the content\\nyou have determined you need.\\nThis might start out with building storyboards\\nand creating any other assets.\\n\\nOne tip here is to give yourself plenty\\nof time in this phase.\\nYou wanna make sure you have all the resources\\nyou need in place and the time to support the creation\\nof these pieces.\\nNext is the implementation phase,\\nwhen you are actually delivering the content\\nand rolling it out to your audience.\\nTo make this phase successful,\\ndevelop and communicate the procedures\\nto facilitators and learners.\\nFacilitators should be able to explain the curriculum,\\nlearning outcomes, method of delivery,\\nand testing procedures to their learners.\\n\\nLearners should get training in the use\\nof new software and hardware,\\nand register before the training begins.\\nEvaluation is the final stage of ADDIE,\\nand it is one of the easiest to skip over,\\nbut the most important not

changes\\nto the revision of your training program,\\nwhich takes you back to the analysis phase.\\n\\nHaving this information will shape\\nyour future learning program and the team who builds it.\\nThe key to understand ADDIE is, it's a cyclical process.\\nAs soon as you end, you begin again.\\nAnd the idea is, the more times you move\\nthrough the process, the better\\nand more polished

a different set\\nof learning needs than kids do.\\n\\nHe called this, andragogy.\\nIn 1984, Knowles developed a list of specific needs\\nto computer training for adults.\\nThese are still relevant and applicable today.\\nLet's take a look at them in more detail.\\nSo first, adult learners need an explanation\\nof the why specific things are being taught.\\nFor those of us who have so many things going on at once,\\nwe need to see the value of something\\nthat will take us away from all that other stuff,\\nso whether it's to improve your finances\\nor to help you manage that new puppy,\\nwe as learners need to see that value\\nand then have the what we are learning\\ntied back to that value.\\n\\nNext, task-orientated or project-based instruction\\ninstead of memorization.\\nWe already have so much in our heads at all time,\\nto make learning really stick for adults,\\ngive them something to do, not memorize.\\nThe action will be more memorable,\\nand therefore more impactful.\\nThen, have different backgrounds considered.\\nIn other words, one size does not fit all.\\nLearning materials and activities\\nshould support different learning levels and types.\\n\\nThe good news is there's so much flexibility\\nand so many options in e-learning,\\ndesigners and learners can customize the content\\nto meet their needs.\\nAnd finally, to discover things and knowledge for themselves\\nwithout depending on other people.\\nIsn't it so much more rewarding and impressionable,\\nwhen you apply a certain learning tool or concept\\nto your life, and then see how it works?\\nAnd then you adjust and modify it\\nto make it even work better.\\n\\nAs a learning designer, give your learner the freedom\\nto make these explorations and have the a-ha moments,\\nbut also make sure you still offer support when needed.\\nIntegrate these timeless principles\\ninto the purpose and structure of your training.\\nDoing so will empower your adult learners\\nwhile guiding them on a valuable journey.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:787915\",\"duration\":185,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Applying Bloom's

for adults.\\nYou must consider the cognitive hierarchy\\nof thought and understanding to determine\\nwhat type of mastery you want your learners to have.\\nAnd there's no better tool to guide us\\nto do this than Bloom's taxonomy.\\nDr. Benjamin Bloom created this tool\\nto promote higher forms of thinking in education.\\n\\nAnd over 60 years later, it still sticks today.\\nThe framework consists of six major categories,\\nand in looking at all the categories,\\nthey actually start at the bottom\\nwith the simplest form of thinking\\nand then build from there.\\nThe idea is that as you are moving a learner\\nto the next level, you have provided a foundation\\nof thought for the previous level.\\nLet's take a look at each one\\nand how they apply to your instructional design.\\nThe first is remember, which is the recall\\nof terminology, methods, and processes.\\n\\nA simple example of this would be\\nmemorizing human anatomy.\\nAt this point, you are only asked\\nto be able to recall this information.\\nThe second level is understand,\\nwhich is comprehending the materials\\nor the ideas being communicated.\\nSo in the example of anatomy,\\nyou would be asked to understand\\nthe bodily structure of humans\\nand how the parts work together.\\nThe third application is the ability\\nto relate topics to situations.\\n\\nAgain, taking the human anatomy example,\\nhere you would begin to apply\\nhow the bodily structure works together\\nin different scenarios.\\nSo for example, if I stubbed my toe,\\nyou may conclude I have bruised skin and tissue.\\nThe fourth analysis is the breakdown of information\\nto look at it from different perspectives.\\nSo looking at the information\\nyou have on my stubbed toe,\\nyou might be able to conclude\\nthe angle I stubbed it at\\nand predict how long it might take to heal.\\n\\nThe fifth is evaluation.\\nAnd that is the assessment of materials\\nand methods being taught.\\nSo again, my poor toe.\\nNow you can evaluate it and prescribe\\na medication or physical therapy routine\\nbased on all the other steps of thinking you have done.\\nAnd finally, creation.\\nThis encourages taking the base of thought\\nand evolving it to an entirely new concept.\\nSo maybe with my stubbed toe,\\nyou have a new idea of how to heal it.\\nMaybe it's a new tincture or exercise for me to do.\\n\\nEither way, you created it based on all the prior thinking\\nyou have done to get to this point.\\nBy considering the level of cognitive hierarchy\\nyou expect from your learners,\\nyou will be able to structure your learning materials\\nand assessments to meet the learners' capability and needs.\\nWhen in doubt, return to the Bloom's triangle and ask,\\nwhat do you want your learners to know and be able to do?\\nI

not\\nbe taking the training in real time.\\n\\nBut that also doesn't mean\\nthat you can't have them interact.\\nWith asynchronous training,\\nwhere the learning is not happening\\nin real time, learners can still reply\\nto discussion board posts or ask\\nother former participants questions.\\nYou can also provide social media groups\\nto expand and continue the dialog even\\nafter the program is over.\\nThis can be in the form of a Facebook\\nor a LinkedIn group.\\nAnd then, if it is in real time, aka synchronous,\\nin addition to the above, you can explore partner\\nor group projects and give them opportunities\\nto discuss topics.\\n\\nWhatever the activity is, having learners not feel\\nthat they are alone in this orbit is critical.\\nAlso provide timely feedback.\\nIf a participant reaches out to you\\nand you don't respond for weeks,\\nthey're likely to feel like they are not important\\nand you might not exist.\\nI once taught an online writing course,\\nnot the

To set up a key account program, follow these steps.  \\n First, you need to decide which accounts are key.  \\n Now it may seem obvious  \\n that you'll select only your largest accounts,  \\n but as you'll see later,  \\n that's not necessarily true.  \\n Instead, you'll develop a set of rigorous criteria  \\n that an account must meet to be considered key.  \\n Sides of the account may not be as important  \\n as other criteria.  \\n Once you've selected your key accounts,  \\n it's time to create a vision, mission and strategic focus  \\n for your key account management program.  \\n Now, it may seem odd to develop your strategy  \\n only after selecting key accounts.  \\n Now wouldn't it make more sense to develop a strategy first,  \\n then select accounts  \\n that can help you achieve that strategy?  \\n Well, there's some truth to that.  \\n I like the other way around though better, and here's why.  \\n I'd prefer to know the size and depth  \\n of my key account program ahead of time.  \\n How many accounts do I have to manage?  \\n And what is the depth of my opportunity  \\n and risk in those accounts?  \\n Now armed with that information,  \\n I'm in a much better position  \\n to craft a coherent strategy to achieve success.  \\n Next, you need to align your organization  \\n and gain commitment to the key account management program.  \\n Your program will fail  \\n unless you have the full support  \\n from many departments inside your company,  \\n and perhaps even outside your company.  \\n You have to communicate what you're trying to accomplish  \\n in key accounts and get others to do their part  \\n within the context of your corporate culture.  \\n Now if you try to manage key accounts  \\n outside the corporate culture,  \\n you'll run into trouble.  \\n With a strategy in place and a list of key accounts,  \\n it's time to get to work.  \\n You start by hiring and training  \\n competent key account managers.  \\n Now here's a tip.  \\n Key account managers are not glorified super sales reps.  \\n That could be a big mistake because managing key accounts  \\n is not just selling more products to them.  \\n With your team in place,  \\n it's time to create a plan for each account  \\n that will accomplish the goals you created earlier.  \\n How often will you call on each account?  \\n What will your manager do during those calls  \\n and what partners are needed to help succeed?  \\n Finally, a good key account manager  \\n takes the time to measure results.  \\n This should be done on an ongoing basis,  \\n not just at the end of the year,  \\n and many time, it should be done jointly  \\n with the key accounts.  \\n Now let me warn you.  \\n This can be painful  \\n because part of the process here  \\n is to reevaluate whether a key account  \\n should continue to earn the status.  \\n It may be time to drop certain accounts from the list  \\n and add new ones.  \\n Good key account management  \\n is much more than spending lots of time with big accounts.  \\n It's a methodical, systematic process  \\n that will help your company achieve  \\n great success in the marketplace.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

could be really tempting for a sales rep\\nto sneak in some of those perks to attract a new client,\\nbut if you let that happen,\\nyou dilute the benefits of being a key account.\\nCompanies must find the right balance\\nbetween how they support key accounts\\nversus other accounts and new accounts.\\nThis is why key account management is considered\\na board level activity.\\n\\nThe head of key account management must be senior enough\\nin the organization to negotiate\\nand align with other departments to find that balance.\\nKey account management is a great way\\nto lock in the right

assignment from your company requires careful consideration,\\nas it's meant to be a long-term investment for your executive and your\\nkey accounts executive.\\nThe key account team will map all the relationships you have and those you\\nneed during strategy sessions and discuss who is the best executive on your side\\nto align with your key accounts senior executive.\\n\\nIf your key account is a medium to large-sized company,\\nthen it's probable that multiple senior leader handshakes are necessary.\\nIt's also best with any size account to have a backup executive\\nsponsor that you're cultivating.\\nOnce the handshake meeting is set, your executive must be ready to outline\\nthe benefits and expectations of being part of your key account program.\\nWhat does it mean to be a key account?\\nFor example, top clients benefit from participating\\nin high-level joint strategic planning sessions, extra resources,\\nand custom programs.\\n\\nExecutive sponsors will receive special invitations to high-level events.\\nThey can expect value through access to experts and privileged information\\nsuch as future product roadmaps.\\nKey account executives agree to be actively involved in high-level sessions\\nand to allocate the resources from their team to work with your team.\\nBoth executives commit to discuss and clear roadblocks\\nto progress should they occur.\\nIdeally, this pivotal handshake meeting takes place at the beginning of your\\ncontract, but it can also occur when an account grows to qualify\\nfor your key account program.\\n\\nThe most important thing is that the meeting happens and the handshake follows.\\nThe risk of missing this consequential step is the lack of C-suite buy-in\\nfrom your most important accounts, which can create misalignment\\nin an opening for your competitors.\\nYour competitors want to take your banner account away from you and will\\nseize any opportunity to do so.\\nMany strategic account losses are a result of the lack of an executive sponsor.\\nThe great news is that your top-tier accounts want this type\\nof enhanced relationship.\\n\\nThey need a partner who understands their company, their people,\\nand their top priorities.\\nThey see value in a strategic alliance paired with tactical implementation.\\nThey prefer to grow with a trusted organization that continually\\ndelivers the impacts they require.\\nThe

doing so,\\nthey miss out on the numerous benefits, both for their company and their\\nmost important customers.\\n\\nOne of the vital benefits of having standards for your key account program is\\nthat cross-functional collaboration is enhanced.\\nWhen other departments within your company are clear that tier-one accounts receive\\nextra attention and investments of resources and dollars,\\nthere's very little pushback.\\nInstead, there's a sense of pride associated with working with banner\\naccounts, which is motivating for all.\\nCriteria are also powerful for your key account.\\nThey'll feel valued by being part of your portfolio of tier-one clients,\\nwith access to special programs and top-notch resources.\\n\\nSince those benefits are outlined in the executive-to-executive handshake\\nconversation, all the people working under both\\nexecutives know that their work has been deemed as important.\\nFor example, it's common for both teams to receive C-suite recognition for their\\ncollaborative efforts to build successful programs that deliver results.\\nIt turns out that standards for the key account program were established,\\nso the strategic account manager brought an assessment against the criteria to\\nthe forefront of the prep meeting agenda.\\n\\nThe criteria include a target revenue range and potential for revenue growth.\\nGrowth is defined as total revenue growth in addition to expansion of business\\nlines offered by your company.\\nThe standards outline access to the executive sponsor and account\\ncontacts needed to implement, manage, and grow services.\\nThe final condition is strategic alignment, which incorporates\\ncompatibility of values, culture, and goals.\\n\\nAn example of this final benchmark would be an account with a marquee name,\\nwhich would attract more prospects to your company.\\nStrategic partners and channels who qualify are often part\\nof key account programs as well.\\nAnd for those strategic customers or partners who are not eligible for your key\\naccount program right now, client advisory councils can be\\nan alternative opportunity for high-level engagement.\\nAI is a big help when it comes to establishing and communicating\\nkey account criteria.\\n\\nFor example, during the executive-to-executive\\nhandshake conversation, AI can help your executive translate key\\npoints of your program into benefits for your executive sponsor\\nand their organization.\\nAnother way AI can assist is enhancing general communications.\\nFor instance, reworking a simple email invitation.\\nInstead of a standard invite, AI will enhance your invite to make your\\nclient feel special, thereby reinforcing their inclusion\\nin your key account program.\\n\\nI've included

give everyone the same punch card\\nand the same swipe card and the same perks.\\nBut not all customers are created equal.\\nOne of my clients, a small town local restaurant\\nstructured their loyalty program in this way.\\nThe first interesting thing that they did\\nwas that you had to pay\\nto be a part of their loyalty program.\\n\\nThe second thing that they did was they built perks\\nand rewards based on how high up the ladder you went.\\nTheir best clients who drove the most revenue\\nwere given access to a secret menu\\nthat only they could order from.\\nOther customers wanted to earn enough points\\nto get to that level of loyalty.\\nAnd finally, all customers were given perks and rewards\\nbased on their current loyalty level.\\nThey also published a monthly newsletter\\nwhich highlighted some of the most interesting perks\\nthat their most loyal customers were enjoying.\\nIn turn, this made even more customers\\nwant to join their loyalty program.\\n\\nWithout thinking about their customers\\nand their loyalty program like this,\\neveryone would have just been given a generic punch card.\\nDone right, you can massively grow your customer loyalty\\nand your revenue at the same time.\\nThis is about treating a customer loyalty\\nas a strategic effort and not just some basic card\\nor program that every business must

default, the system shows the intelligence view,\\nbut I want to switch to the standard list views for this demo.\\nAs you know, you can select another list view\\nfrom this menu.\\n\\nAnd if you look over here,\\nyou have some actions and other controls.\\nThis gear, this is the list view controls.\\nFrom here you can create a new list view,\\nclone the view that you're on,\\nrename the view that you're looking at,\\nor add some additional columns.\\nTo create a custom list view,\\nyou could click New from this controls menu,\\nbut instead, let's clone a view.\\nCloning an existing list view is a bit more efficient\\nsince it copies the filters and the columns\\nto get us started.\\n\\nSo choose a view that you like.\\nI like all open leads 'cause it gives us a good jumpstart.\\nAnd then come back to the gear and click Clone.\\nName the view,\\nand then just click into the API name field\\nthat will auto-populate for you.\\nThis field is just the system name\\nfor the list view that you're creating,\\nand you may have an option to create views\\nand share it with others,\\nbut for now, just select only I can see this view,\\nand then click Save.\\n\\nAnd you're taken to the new list view\\nwith some filters applied.\\nChanging the filters will change\\nwhich records display in this view.\\nAnd there's always some preset filters\\nthat can be modified.\\nSo first we can filter by owner.\\nSelecting My Leads applies a filter\\nwhere you are the owner,\\nand that literally means that your name\\nis in the owner field on the record.\\nSo it's My Leads.\\nAll Leads would show all records\\nregardless of user ownership.\\n\\nSo for this list view,\\nmake sure you've selected All Leads\\nand then click Done.\\nThe next preset filter\\nthat we have is based on the lead status field.\\nBy default, this one is preset\\nto lead status field does not contain is closed.\\nSo the lead status is not a closed lead,\\nand which we can interpret that to mean this lead is open,\\nanything on this list will be open\\nand the lead is still being worked by someone.\\nBut notice, you can click on that option\\nand change this filter to draw from any\\nof the fields on the lead object.\\n\\nIf you click into this top option,\\nyou could use this to filter on any\\nof the other fields like industry,\\nowner name, lead source, any of these options listed.\\nSo let's select Rating.\\nSo click on Rating, leave the operator as equals,\\nso it's Rating, equals, and then click into the value field.\\nYou choose any of the field options\\nby just clicking on them.\\nSo let's click both Hot and Warm.\\n\\nSo Rating equals hot or warm.\\nAnd then click Done.\\nSo the list filters for this list view\\nare All Leads where the rating field\\nis either hot or warm.\\nAnd notice we can continue to add more filters if needed.\\nYou just click Add Filter, choose the field to use,\\nthe operator, and then enter the value.\\nSo when you have your filters all dialed in,\\njust click Save,\\nand your new list will now display all records\\nthat match that filter criteria.\\n\\nAnd you can hide the filters panel by just clicking this X.\\nAnd to edit the filters, you can come back\\nand click on the little funnel icon.\\nAnd notice you have the option to change the display\\nof this view, to either kanban or a split view.\\nThe split view displays your records in a list\\nwith some details in the center.\\nAnd the kanban will display your data on a board,\\nmeant for tracking status or progress.\\n\\nSo this is our custom leads list view in the kanban layout.\\nThis is one of my favorite Salesforce features\\nbecause at its core, Salesforce is supposed\\nto help us get organized and stay focused.\\nAnd I find that a custom list view\\nof exactly the records that I need to see\\nin the kanban or split view layout, does exactly that.\\nSo now let's wrap up with my favorite time saver,\\nediting from a list view.\\nI'm going to jump over to the accounts tab\\nand show you one of my views\\nand show you this from the account list.\\n\\nAs you hover on the information in each row,\\nyou might see a pencil icon.\\nThis pencil icon indicates that you can edit the data\\non the record, right from the list view.\\nTo add data or change data on the record,\\nyou just click the pencil,\\nmake the change in the cell that pops up,\\nand you can make a couple of changes,\\nand then click Save.\\nAnd you've just edited all those records.\\nYou can also make mass edits from a list view.\\n\\nYou click the action boxes over here on the far left\\nfor all the records that need the edit.\\nAnd then just double click the pencil icon\\non one of the records, make the change,\\nand be sure to select to update all the selected items,\\nmake that change and then save.\\nSo if you ever find yourself doing lots of data cleanup,\\nremember this feature that allows you\\nto edit from a list

[Instructor] Let's look at how to navigate the reports tab\\nand access the folders\\nand reports that have been created for you.\\nWhen you click on the reports tab,\\nyou're taken to this list of recently viewed reports.\\nSo if you've never viewed a report, this page will be blank,\\nbut don't let that throw you off.\\nIf you're using a practice org\\nand following along, there are reports available for you\\nto browse, but they may not be very helpful or relevant.\\nIn the next videos,\\nI show you how to create more relevant reports,\\nbut if you're learning Salesforce in a real org\\nwith your job,\\nIt's still isn't very obvious how\\nto navigate this page, let's start there.\\n\\nOn this tab, the first time you visit the reports tab,\\nthe page will be blank\\nbecause you haven't viewed any reports yet,\\nbut let's look at this menu over on the left.\\nThere will be reports over here\\nthat you have access to.\\nNotice that there's three sections to this menu,\\na section of reports, a section of folders,\\nand a quick link to folders\\nor reports that you've favorited.\\nSo starting at the top with reports,\\nthese are basically list views.\\n\\nThe first list contains reports that you created,\\nand I created a few samples, so I have some on my list,\\nbut you may not.\\nNext is any reports that you created\\nand that are stored in your private reports folder.\\nReports stored in private reports,\\nthose are only accessible by you.\\nMost users store reports that they created in this folder,\\nunless they're planning to share the report\\nwith other users.\\n\\nPublic reports contain any reports that are shared\\nwith all users in your company.\\nAnd in a practice org.\\nThere are lots of samples,\\nbut they are not basic user reports.\\nThey're actually designed for advanced system admins,\\nso they aren't super relevant for sales or marketing users.\\nSo don't be discouraged if you look at some of these samples\\nand they don't make sense.\\nThis last option will be a list of a combination of all\\nof the above,\\nall the reports that you as a user have access to.\\n\\nSo let's talk about the search feature for a moment.\\nI always like to explain this because it has a few quirks.\\nNotice that whichever list you're on,\\nthe search box says search that list,\\nsearch recent, search private reports.\\nDo you see that?\\nThis search feature is only searching\\nthat list for a report name\\nor a word in the description that matches your search term.\\n\\nSo if you're looking for a specific report using a key word,\\nmake sure you're clicked on all reports\\nor one of these lists\\nwhere the report is likely to be found.\\nI'll show you an example.\\nHere is a report called Program Milestones.\\nIt's stored in this folder.\\nSo if I happen to be looking at the list of public reports,\\nfor example, and I search public reports\\nfor something named milestones, no results found.\\n\\nBut if I search all reports, there it is.\\nThis is probably the number one support question\\nthat I get from my users.\\nThey know that there is a report\\nwith a specific word in the report name,\\nbut they can't find it,\\nand it's because they've accidentally limited the search\\nbecause they're only searching within one of these lists.\\nNow, this same situation happens\\nwhen you're clicked on a folder.\\nIf I click all folders\\nand I search for milestones, no results found,\\nthat's because searching folders\\nis not looking at the reports within the folder.\\n\\nIt's searching for a folder name\\nwith the word milestones in it.\\nFolder search, it only searches folder names,\\nnot report name, not report description,\\njust the name of a folder\\nthat includes that search term.\\nSo bottom line, if you're searching for a specific report,\\neither use a global search up here\\nor search all reports.\\nBack to folders,\\nall reports are stored in a folder,\\nand that's actually how reports are created\\nand shared with you or shared with your team\\nor another group of users.\\n\\nThe report itself isn't shared,\\nwe actually share the folder.\\nSo when a folder has been shared with you,\\nyou'll be able to see all the reports stored in that folder.\\nAnd keep in mind, these lists mean folders created by me,\\nfolders shared with me.\\nSo let's talk about favorites.\\nFavorites is a really useful feature.\\nYou can favorite any folder or any report\\nand then you can just click here to see that list.\\n\\nTo favorite a folder from the list of folders,\\nyou just click this action arrow and choose Favorite.\\nAnd to do that with a report from the list,\\nyou just do the same thing, click the action arrow.\\nOr if you're already looking at the report,\\nyou click the star\\nand it will be added to your list of favorites.\\nSo I encourage you to explore the reports tab,\\nget really comfortable navigating reports and dashboards,\\nbecause the promise of Salesforce is to have all\\nof your customer data right at your fingertips,\\nand reports are a big part of that.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3971027\",\"duration\":308,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Use simple account and contact

it's stored,\\nand some of the other columns of information.\\nClicking on the name of the report brings up the report.\\n\\nSo I'm going to choose this report that I created,\\nmy contacts grouped by account name.\\nSo this is a sample report that I created for this demo.\\nIf you're using a practice org,\\nclick on one of the samples provided\\njust to get a feel for the navigation.\\nIn the next video, I show you how to create a report\\nthat will have some more relevant data.\\nWhen I click on the report, it takes me to the report page.\\nOn this page, I can see\\nthat there are a total of 27 contacts.\\n\\nAnd remember, contacts are the people that we work with\\nat each of these accounts or business locations.\\nThis report is showing the columns of data\\nfor the account name,\\nthe first and last name of the contact, the person's title,\\ntheir phone number from their contact record,\\ntheir email address,\\nand notice as I roll over the blue words,\\nthey become underlined,\\nand that tells you that they're clickable.\\nIf you click on the account name,\\nit will take you to the account record,\\nand clicking on the first or last name,\\nthat will launch the contact record.\\n\\nAnd I'm always surprised that longtime users don't know\\nthat you can click into records from a report,\\nthat any of these underlined blue words are links\\nto records, so if you've clicked into one of the records\\nto get back to the report,\\nyou can quickly launch the report again\\nfrom the reports tab, from this little down arrow.\\nSo on the report,\\nyou have several buttons here in the top right.\\n\\nIf you want to search for a specific piece of data\\nwithin the report, you can use this search here,\\nand search results will be highlighted on the page.\\nIf you want to see the data in visual format,\\nyou can toggle this chart option on\\nand use the chart properties to select an appropriate chart.\\nNow you only see the chart option\\nif your report has been grouped or summarized in some way.\\nIf it's just a straight up list,\\nyou won't see the chart option.\\n\\nThe chart is only for a report that's in summary,\\nsummarizing some data in some way.\\nIf you want to change the filters applied to this report,\\nyou can click this little funnel icon\\nand modify the filters,\\nlike maybe you want to see only contacts\\ncreated this current fiscal year,\\nor contacts at accounts within a certain industry.\\nSo we can make those changes\\nand then see how the data changes.\\n\\nNow this is just a temporary change.\\nIt's a temporary filter.\\nOnce we step off this report,\\nit will revert back to the original filter.\\nThe refresh button will bring new data into the report\\nthat maybe has been added to Salesforce\\nsince you launched the report page.\\nIf you have edit permissions on this report,\\nyou'll see an edit button.\\nIf you want to save a version of this report\\nwith any of the added

then save the modified report\\nto your own private reports folder.\\nNow you can subscribe to receive an email copy\\nof the report, so don't sleep on this option.\\nIf you have data that you need to

launcher,\\nthis colorful dot icon, and search for reports.\\nClick new report, it's a button in the top right,\\nand then choose the type of data you want to report on.\\nThis choice here is actually the most important step\\nin creating a report.\\n\\nYou need to know where the data is that you want to analyze,\\nwhich object holds the data, which fields hold the data.\\nSalesforce gives us some predefined report types\\nfor the objects that we commonly work with, like accounts,\\ncontacts, opportunities, leads.\\nAll the report types are grouped into categories\\nand you can click each category to explore\\nand find the appropriate report type for your needs.\\n\\nNotice that if you want\\nto create a report using the cases object,\\nthose report types are in this category, support reports.\\nSo let's start with a simple report,\\ndrawing from account data.\\nAnd I'm going to show you how to build a list of my accounts\\nwith contacts that have been created this fiscal year.\\nSo to choose an account report type,\\nI'll click on the category for accounts and contacts\\nand review the list of options.\\n\\nAnd then I'm just going to choose contacts and accounts.\\nWhen I click this option, another side panel appears.\\nThis panel explains all the report type presets,\\nwhich objects are used, the specific data from fields\\nthat can be displayed, like displayed in the report\\nor used as filters\\nand any reports that have already been created using\\nthat report type either by you or by another user.\\nSo click the blue start report button.\\n\\nOh, and here's a handy shortcut.\\nIf you think one of the other reports listed here\\nis a pretty good report that you just want to modify,\\nclick on that and then just do a save as.\\nBut if you want to create it from scratch,\\njust click start report\\nand then you're taken into the Report Builder interface.\\nSo there are three areas to this interface.\\nThe first is this center area that shows a preview\\nof the data that will display in the report.\\nNow this is just a preview.\\n\\nIt's a preview of about 20 records so that you can see\\nhow the report takes shape as you build it.\\nYou're not going to see the full data set\\nuntil you actually run the report.\\nSo if you ever find yourself thinking, oh,\\nthis isn't working 'cause I know for sure there's records\\nthat would meet this criteria,\\nbut they're not showing here, don't listen to that.\\nThis is just a preview.\\nThe real data will show once you run the report.\\nThe second area is here on the left,\\nwe have a panel with two tabs, outline and filters.\\n\\nSo I'll come back to that in a second.\\nThe third is hiding here far off to the left.\\nIf you expand this little arrow, you can see all the fields\\nthat you could use in this report type.\\nThey're grouped by object and field type,\\nbut collapse that for now.\\nGo back to this area.\\nClick on filters.\\nThere's a small number telling you\\nhow many standard filters are in use,\\nand all report types come preset with at least two filters,\\nshow me and a date field.\\n\\nSo click on \\\"show me\\\".\\nSee how you have some options?\\nThis filter, this filter's on record ownership.\\nSo you go my contacts or my accounts.\\nThat'll be a list of all the records\\nwhere you are the record owner,\\nlike literally your name is in the owner field\\non the record.\\nAll accounts is a list of all the account records\\nin that org.\\nMy team's accounts, that's used by sales leaders\\nor other managers to see records owned by members\\nof their sales team, for example.\\n\\nFor this report, change the filter to show my accounts\\nand notice how the center preview, it's not changing\\nas you modify your filters.\\nSo to see the effects of these changes,\\nyou can refresh the preview each time,\\nor you can toggle on update preview automatically.\\nIt's really your preference.\\nThe other preset filter is a date field.\\nThere will always be a date filter.\\nIt usually defaults to created date\\nwith some narrow date range.\\n\\nBut you can change this.\\nYou just click in the date box\\nto choose any date field from the object,\\nand then set the range.\\nAnd be sure to scroll to see the long list of options\\nfor defining the date range.\\nBut sometimes a date isn't necessary.\\nSo if the data that you want to analyze\\ndoesn't depend on a specific timeframe,\\nyou can select any date field\\nand then choose all time as the range.\\nSo any date field, range equals all time.\\n\\nAnd this removes any date restrictions,\\nallowing you to view all the relevant records\\nwithout a date consideration.\\nSo for this report, choose create a date\\nand in the range option, choose current fiscal year.\\nCreate a date, current fiscal year,\\nand then click apply.\\nAnd then refresh the preview to see the updated data.\\nThe outline tab shows you all the columns of data\\nthat will be displayed in the report\\nand whether there are any summary groupings.\\n\\nYou can remove data columns by clicking the little x.\\nNow, reorder some columns by clicking\\nand dragging them into the new position.\\nI'll move account owner up to the first spot\\nand then account name above that,\\nand then refresh to see how that looks.\\nYou can add additional columns of data on the outline panel.\\nYou just click right here, add columns,\\nand then you find the data that you want to see.\\n\\nYou just add a couple of those like that.\\nNow if you're unsure which columns can be added\\nand you want to browse,\\nthat's where this field option is helpful.\\nIf you expand this,\\nyou can see all the options you have from the objects\\nincluded in this report type.\\nWhen you find the field that you want,\\nyou simply double click\\nand the field is added to the first column position.\\nYou see that?\\nAnd you can reorder the columns again\\nfrom the outline panel.\\n\\nSo when you have your report all dialed in,\\nclick save and run.\\nAnd then I recommend that you\\ndelete the generic report name.\\nAdd your own descriptive name.\\nAlso, you should always remove the default unique name.\\nSo there's a trick to this.\\nYou just highlight the unique name\\nand delete it using the delete key on your keyboard.\\nAnd then click into the report name field again.\\nThen click into unique name\\nand it will populate automatically.\\n\\nAnd I encourage you\\nto always include a descriptive description\\nbecause you can actually see this from the report tab.\\nIf you're sharing this report with other people,\\nthey will see this description\\nand then save your report to a folder.\\nNotice you have a default private reports folder.\\nLet's go ahead and use that.\\nAnd then just click save.\\nAnd you're taken to your newly created report.\\nSo if the report still needs some tweaking\\nafter you see it in its run state, you just click

[Instructor] As soon as you have an indication\\nfrom your customer that they're interested to buy products\\nor services, you'll create an opportunity record.\\nSo let's review the ways that you can do that.\\nFirst is by adding the opportunity\\nto the existing account record.\\nWe use this approach when the customer is already listed\\nin Salesforce, and has a relationship with us,\\nand we've worked with them on past deals.\\nYou navigate to the account record,\\nand from the related tab,\\nscroll down to see the opportunities section.\\n\\nAnd if there's a past deal in here that's really similar,\\nI can clone it, or I can click the new button,\\nand I see the screen to populate all the fields\\nfor this opportunity.\\nThe opportunity name is a descriptive name\\nthat represents this deal.\\nYour sales team may have a specific naming convention\\nfor opportunities, so be sure to ask about that.\\nAccount name is copied over from the account record\\nwhere we started.\\nThe type field tracks whether this is an existing customer\\nor a new customer.\\n\\nAnd often this menu is customized specifically\\nfor your selling scenarios.\\nSo you just choose what type of opportunity this is.\\nThe lead source is populated when we have a clear idea\\nof what generated the interest in this particular deal.\\nIt may already be populated if this deal came\\nfrom a recent campaign.\\nNow the amount field is really important.\\nThis is an estimate of the total value\\nof this one opportunity.\\n\\nIf you get a yes decision on this deal,\\nwhat's the revenue amount that will be invoiced?\\nAnd it'll likely be a rough estimate at first,\\nbut as you learn more about the customer's needs,\\nyou'll dial this in.\\nThe close date is also an estimate,\\nand it may change frequently as you get more information.\\nSo just start off with an estimated date,\\nmaybe the end of the year or the end of this quarter,\\nand then update it as you learn more.\\nNext step is not always used.\\n\\nThat's a place for you to type in a reminder\\nfor yourself about what next step\\nwill move this conversation forward.\\nSomething you need to do\\nor you're waiting for from the client,\\nyou would note that here.\\nThe stage, that's another critical field.\\nThese options represent the specific stages\\nor milestones that this potential deal goes through.\\nAnd usually, you start with an earlier stage,\\nand then you update this frequently\\nas the discussion progresses.\\n\\nNotice that the stage is going to correlate\\nwith probability.\\nI'll show you an example.\\nIf I select qualification, it sets the probability at 10%.\\nIf I change to negotiation\\nand review, it changes to 90%.\\nThis is really useful when you're doing forecasting.\\nI can also manually adjust this if it's needed,\\nbut I'll set this back to qualification.\\n\\nThere may be other fields that your team requires,\\nbut for now I'll just click save,\\nand you'll see that I now have an opportunity listed here\\non the account record.\\nData from that opportunity will be included\\nin relevant forecasting and pipeline reports.\\nAnd when I'm ready to review\\nor update the record, I can click the name here,\\nand I'll go to the record.\\nI can update the stage using the path tool,\\nor I can click edit and update other fields.\\n\\nSo that's one way\\nto add an opportunity record to Salesforce.\\nOh, and remember, everything I just showed you\\npretty much can be done from the mobile app as well,\\nbut let's look at a few additional ways\\nthat you can add an opportunity.\\nI can use the plus sign and select new opportunity.\\nI like this option for times when I'm in the middle\\nof something, and I want to stay focused on what I'm doing,\\nbut I also don't want to forget to add this opportunity.\\nIt brings up a docked window that I can quickly populate\\nwith a few fields, and then I can minimize it\\nand go back to what I was working on,\\nand the docked window will stay here\\nuntil I finally get back around to completing it.\\n\\nI can also use this option if I have\\nto add a new account record and an opportunity record.\\nClicking new account here will bring up the screen for me\\nto add a new account record.\\nIf I find that the account still needs to be added\\nto Salesforce, I should add the account first,\\nthen the opportunity.\\nAnother option is to navigate to the opportunities tab\\nand click new opportunity.\\nThis brings up the full-screen option\\nthat we reviewed a minute ago.\\n\\nAnother common way to add an opportunity is\\nthrough converting a lead that's gone\\nthrough your qualification process\\nand will be converted in Salesforce to a customer account,\\na contact, and an opportunity.\\nThe specifics on that process are covered in the video\\non lead conversion.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3965720\",\"duration\":200,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Link contacts

tracked\\nand recorded in Salesforce.\\nAnd again, it could be a planned meeting\\nor a log of an impromptu meeting.\\nSo it can be a future planned meeting\\nor something that already occurred.\\nAnd the difference between events and log a call\\nis events gives you the option\\nto capture the specific date and time\\nand the duration of that interaction.\\n\\nAnd remember, these docked windows will stay here\\neven if you navigate to another record.\\nI find this so helpful\\nwhen I need to capture something quickly,\\nbut I don't want to get too distracted or on a tangent.\\nThe last option is sending an email from within Salesforce.\\nNow, not all companies use this option,\\nso you may not even see this button in your real org.\\nMany companies have an integration\\nwith your office email software\\nand you send emails using your standard email app.\\n\\nBut sending the email right from Salesforce\\nkeeps all the interactions about an opportunity\\nor a lead or a contact\\nkeeps it documented and tracked right here in Salesforce.\\nWhen you click, you get a docked window,\\nbut it's a little cramped.\\nSo on this one,\\nyou might want to click these little arrows\\nto expand the window.\\nOn the two line,\\nstart to type the contact's name.\\nThis initiates a search for the correct contact.\\n\\nYou can also just type in the email address of a person.\\nYou can enter a subject line,\\nand then type out your email.\\nBut notice the little icons down here.\\nYou can include attachments,\\nand you might have some prebuilt templates available.\\nSo be sure to explore this little icon.\\nClicking on the eye icon allows you to preview the email\\nbefore sending it.\\nAnd then after you send,\\nthe email is logged as a completed activity\\non the opportunity record.\\n\\nAny colleague with access to see this record\\ncan see the interaction history\\nand its clear what tasks have been completed,\\nwhat might still be

Next.\\n\\nName the calendar.\\nFor Opportunities, we just want them to show\\nat the top of the calendar like an all-day item,\\nso we only need to populate the Start date.\\nSo we'll use the Close Date as the field for Start.\\nAnd we don't need a field to end\\nsince there's not really\\na start and end time and date.\\nChoose a list of which opportunities\\nshould display on your calendar.\\nYou probably just want\\nto show your open opportunity records,\\nbut this list is smart.\\n\\nIt will offer options from the list views on this object.\\nSo if you're a sales leader,\\nyou could add a list view for my team's opportunities\\nor high stakes opportunities.\\nAnd lastly, choose which field\\nfrom the opportunity record should actually display.\\nLike, usually we'd choose the opportunity name,\\nbut you could also show the account name.\\nAnd for some reason,\\nthe opportunity name is way down here\\ntowards the bottom of the list, and Save.\\n\\nAnd here it is on the list here,\\nand the records now show up here.\\nAnd you can change the color or edit if needed\\nfrom this arrow.\\nYou should also add your tasks to this calendar.\\nI am a huge fan of to-do lists,\\nand I love a system\\nthat lists my tasks for me on the due date.\\nSo to add your tasks, you follow the same steps.\\nNew Calendar, choose the task object,\\nname it My Tasks,\\nand let's use Due Date as the date to show.\\n\\nAnd I'll choose My Open Tasks as the list,\\nand the Subject field makes sense here.\\nAnd Save.\\nLook at that.\\nAnd I think I'll change this color.\\nI love having this at-a-glance option\\nto see everything that's scheduled for this week,\\nall on one tab.\\nAnd I don't have to stop here.\\nAny object I use that has a date-bound\\nor time-bound

[Instructor] In Salesforce, your goal with leads\\nis to drive towards conversion,\\nor it's to determine that the lead is not a true prospect\\nand mark them unqualified.\\nBut what do I mean by qualified?\\nLead qualification is all the work that you do\\nto gather information about the person,\\ntheir level in the company, are they a decision maker\\nand more information about the company,\\nthe budget, their readiness to purchase, their timeline.\\nIt's all the detective work that you do to determine\\nif this person and the company\\nwill potentially buy what you offer,\\nthat's lead qualification.\\n\\nYour company will likely have a customized process\\nwith their defined milestones and lead statuses,\\nand it's the role of the sales rep to capture the research,\\nthe milestones, and the ultimate qualified decision\\nin Salesforce.\\nYou can access your list of leads in a few ways.\\nThe build pipeline widget on your home tab\\nwill show your list of leads created in the last month,\\nand how many don't have any planned actions.\\n\\nYou can click on view leads to be taken to the leads tab.\\nLeads has a list view option called intelligence view.\\nYou can see a snapshot of the total number of leads\\nthat you're responsible for, your activity levels,\\nhow many lead records have no planned future tasks.\\nYou might want to create a custom intelligence view\\nto see My Open Leads and work from that list\\nto start all of your detective work.\\nAnd this is normally where I would recommend that\\nyou create a few lead reports\\nand maybe collate them into a dashboard.\\n\\nBut I actually think that this intelligence view\\nis more helpful.\\nI recommend that you create a few more views\\nlike my unread leads, my leads by status and lead score\\nthat gives you a working list plus all the shortcuts\\nto take action or update the records right from this list.\\nAnd remember the tip about mass edits from list views.\\nIf you have edits to some of the records\\nor a lot of records, remember you can do that\\nfrom a list view or right from an intelligence view.\\n\\nAnd did you catch earlier when I said your unread leads?\\nYou should know that there's a hidden field\\non the lead record\\nthat tracks whether or not the assigned owner has opened\\nand viewed that lead record.\\nAnd marketing will likely be looking at reports\\nof who is not opening and working their assigned leads.\\nNow, the most important parts of managing your leads is\\nfirst track all of your interactions and second,\\nto capture data about the person and the company.\\n\\nSo, navigate a lead record.\\nTo log an interaction or make more detailed changes,\\nyou just click into the record.\\nThe activity tab has all the familiar options to log\\nand track your activity with the lead\\nand don't skip this, capture every reach out, every email,\\nevery interaction, because marketing and sales leadership,\\nthey need the activity data\\nto know that you're working this lead.\\nAnd as you make progress with your qualification,\\nyou update the lead status.\\n\\nThis is another way you convey generally\\nwhere you are with qualifying the lead\\nand you can do that on the lead status field\\nor right here on the path graphic.\\nWe track all the details about the lead\\non the lead record in the details tab.\\nSome of the details were provided to you,\\nand you won't have all this information at first,\\nbut you'll use your detective skills to find out the rest.\\nAnd clearly, you want this record to be\\nas complete as possible before it's converted.\\n\\nSo let's touch on the lead score field.\\nEvery marketing team designs their lead scoring calculation\\nto assign points based on the factors\\nthat signal compatibility with your offerings.\\nIt's usually a number between 1 and 100\\nand points are added for factors like\\nthe demographics of the person, details about the company,\\nonline behaviors or interactions with your company\\non the socials.\\nAnd the higher the score, the higher the likelihood\\nthat the person will engage with your company.\\n\\nYour job as the lead qualifier is to collect more intel\\nto confirm that compatibility.\\nIf you determine that the lead is not a good match,\\nyou change the status to your closed option\\nand you don't convert it.\\nAnd you can usually do that right from the path tool\\nor if this is a good name from a good company\\nthat you determine to be qualified\\nlike a qualified sales prospect\\nthat could become the source of an
