[33m### Successful sales team management[0m

[33m - The lifeblood of any company is the revenue that you earn  [0m
[33m from a steady stream of paying customers.  [0m
[33m For that, you typically need an effective  [0m
[33m and well-managed sales team.  [0m
[33m That's why in many companies,  [0m
[33m the managers who manage the sales force  [0m
[33m are the single most important employees in the company.  [0m
[33m I'm Drew Boyd  [0m
[33m and I've been in the marketing and sales profession  [0m
[33m for over [0m[1;33m30[0m[33m years.  [0m
[33m I teach sales management to graduate students  [0m
[33m and I help companies improve their commercial effectiveness.  [0m
[33m Whether you have an existing sales force  [0m
[33m or you're starting from scratch to create a new one,  [0m
[33m this course teaches you a step-by-step systematic process  [0m
[33m for creating and managing an effective sales team.  [0m
[33m You'll learn the tools and frameworks on how to recruit,  [0m
[33m motivate, deploy, and measure sales representatives.  [0m
[33m Like marketing, sales management  [0m
[33m is an exciting career field of its own,  [0m
[33m but it takes talent and dedication.  [0m
[33m Through the concepts I'll share with you in this course,  [0m
[33m you'll begin to develop the skills  [0m
[33m to become an outstanding sales manager.  [0m
[33m So join me and let's get started.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m. Understanding Sales Management[0m

[33m### What is sales management?[0m

[33m - Sales management is a comprehensive set of activities  [0m
[33m to create and manage a sales team.  [0m
[33m Think of sales management as a cyclical process.  [0m
[33m It starts by understanding the commercial marketing strategy  [0m
[33m of the firm or business unit,  [0m
[33m and then translating marketing strategy  [0m
[33m into a concise and well-defined sales strategy,  [0m
[33m or what we'll call in this course, the sales task.  [0m
[33m The sales task defines exactly  [0m
[33m what sales representatives need to do to be successful,  [0m
[33m what customers do we call on,  [0m
[33m what products and services do we sell,  [0m
[33m and how to sell them.  [0m
[33m Once the sales task is defined,  [0m
[33m every decision and every action taken by the sales manager  [0m
[33m is shaped by it.  [0m
[33m For example, the next step of the sales management process  [0m
[33m is to create a structure for your sales team.  [0m
[33m How many reps you hire  [0m
[33m and how you deploy them all depends on the sales task.  [0m
[33m Highly successful sales managers  [0m
[33m spend a lot of time recruiting, hiring, training,  [0m
[33m and motivating great salespeople.  [0m
[33m Hey, it's the old saying.  [0m
[33m A players stay A players by hiring  [0m
[33m and developing other A players underneath them.  [0m
[33m Sales management is about getting the best  [0m
[33m and most qualified people for the job.  [0m
[33m Once you have a competent team,  [0m
[33m you create a separate territory for each rep  [0m
[33m and give each rep a quota  [0m
[33m of how much you expect them to sell.  [0m
[33m Now, sales reps don't work for free,  [0m
[33m so the sales manager needs  [0m
[33m to structure a compensation program  [0m
[33m that rewards reps for doing the right things to succeed.  [0m
[33m Sales compensation is linked  [0m
[33m to just about every other aspect of sales management,  [0m
[33m so you need to know how this powerful tool works.  [0m
[33m Finally, sales managers measure results  [0m
[33m and they hold their team accountable for those results,  [0m
[33m but the key is to measure the right things  [0m
[33m that link to the sales task.  [0m
[33m Ultimately, measuring sales results feeds right back  [0m
[33m into the marketing team so they can take these results,  [0m
[33m adjust the commercial strategy,  [0m
[33m and start the sales management cycle all over again.  [0m
[33m Sales management is not just patting people on the back  [0m
[33m and telling them to go out there and do their best.  [0m
[33m It's a disciplined managerial method based on data  [0m
[33m and a well-defined process to keep your company successful  [0m
[33m in the face of stiff competition.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Defining the sales task[0m

[33m - Defining the sales task is the first  [0m
[33m and most important step  [0m
[33m in the sales management process.  [0m
[33m A well-defined sales task lays down the foundation  [0m
[33m upon which everything else is built.  [0m
[33m There are four questions you answer  [0m
[33m to define the sales task.  [0m
[33m First, which customers are we going after?  [0m
[33m Now, it may seem obvious  [0m
[33m but salespeople are more effective  [0m
[33m when they have a clear target.  [0m
[33m And the more detailed you can be, the better.  [0m
[33m For example, if you're selling medical equipment  [0m
[33m to hospitals, your direction might sound like this.  [0m
[33m Call on all purchasing managers  [0m
[33m in hospitals with more than [0m[1;33m100[0m[33m beds  [0m
[33m within these zip codes.  [0m
[33m Next, you decide what products  [0m
[33m and services you want the team to sell.  [0m
[33m Now, once again, the more detailed you can be, the better.  [0m
[33m Using our medical example,  [0m
[33m your direction might be this.  [0m
[33m Sell diagnostic equipment to cancer centers,  [0m
[33m sell surgical equipment to community hospitals.  [0m
[33m And so on.  [0m
[33m Now, this is where the sales manager  [0m
[33m and the marketing team must be in sync.  [0m
[33m The third part of the sales task defines exactly  [0m
[33m what activities must be accomplished  [0m
[33m to sell a product to a customer.  [0m
[33m How many calls do you want your sales reps to make  [0m
[33m to each customer and what do you want them to do  [0m
[33m when they meet with a customer?  [0m
[33m For example, do you want them  [0m
[33m to demonstrate the product?  [0m
[33m Ask customers about their needs?  [0m
[33m Perhaps negotiate pricing.  [0m
[33m Get commitments.  [0m
[33m Take orders, follow up with customers and so on.  [0m
[33m Hey, don't leave it up to your sales reps  [0m
[33m to figure it out.  [0m
[33m Defining what you want done during the selling process  [0m
[33m will make them more efficient and more effective.  [0m
[33m And finally, what communications do you want your team  [0m
[33m to report back to your company?  [0m
[33m Hey, sales reps tend to work independently  [0m
[33m in most situations  [0m
[33m but they still need to have connections back  [0m
[33m to certain departments within your company.  [0m
[33m For example, sales reps might need interaction  [0m
[33m with a customer service center,  [0m
[33m a shipping department or perhaps a financing  [0m
[33m and leasing team.  [0m
[33m It depends on the nature of your business, of course,  [0m
[33m but sales reps need to have a clear understanding  [0m
[33m of where to get support and help  [0m
[33m to get the job done.  [0m
[33m You don't want them running around trying  [0m
[33m to figure out who to call to solve a problem.  [0m
[33m That takes away valuable selling time  [0m
[33m from the field and that will lower your sales.  [0m
[33m Using our medical example,  [0m
[33m you might specify that reps have regular contact  [0m
[33m with your medical affairs department,  [0m
[33m your ordering and supply staff  [0m
[33m and the marketing team  [0m
[33m when they get specific questions  [0m
[33m from hospital staff members.  [0m
[33m Who do we target?  [0m
[33m What do we sell? How do we sell it?  [0m
[33m And where do we go for support?  [0m
[33m You'll hear me refer to the sales tasks  [0m
[33m throughout the rest of this course  [0m
[33m because it's such a critical component  [0m
[33m of your success as a sales manager.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m2[0m[33m. Acquiring Sales Talent[0m

[33m### Recruiting salespeople[0m

[33m - Recruiting and hiring sales reps is so important  [0m
[33m that the best sales managers get actively involved  [0m
[33m in the process.  [0m
[33m They see recruiting as an ongoing activity  [0m
[33m so they always have qualified candidates  [0m
[33m who can step right in to an open position.  [0m
[33m Here are the steps you take to hire sales reps.  [0m
[33m First, develop a profile of the type of person  [0m
[33m who can perform the sales task.  [0m
[33m Look closely at the sales task and ask yourself,  [0m
[33m what skills does a rep need  [0m
[33m or be able to acquire to do the job?  [0m
[33m Do they need technical skills, quantitative skills,  [0m
[33m presentation skills and so on?  [0m
[33m For example, selling medical products  [0m
[33m might require skills related to medical procedures  [0m
[33m but selling financial services  [0m
[33m might require more skills in presentation and negotiation.  [0m
[33m Also ask what knowledge is needed to do the job.  [0m
[33m Do they need knowledge about your industry  [0m
[33m or perhaps knowledge about a certain topic,  [0m
[33m such as biology or engineering?  [0m
[33m And finally, what dispositions and behaviors  [0m
[33m do they need for the job?  [0m
[33m Do you want people with high energy  [0m
[33m or perhaps people who are more easy going  [0m
[33m and great at forming relationships?  [0m
[33m Now, once you have a profile,  [0m
[33m work with your HR team to create a job description,  [0m
[33m which includes elements of the profile,  [0m
[33m along with job duties as described in the sales task.  [0m
[33m Now, depending on the job,  [0m
[33m there are lots of sources of potential sales recruits.  [0m
[33m Start by looking inside your own company.  [0m
[33m You might be surprised  [0m
[33m at how that quiet, shy engineer  [0m
[33m could become a superstar salesperson.  [0m
[33m Your own employees already know your products  [0m
[33m and industry, so they're an excellent source  [0m
[33m to fill openings.  [0m
[33m Other sources include referrals,  [0m
[33m staffing agencies, universities,  [0m
[33m former military personnel,  [0m
[33m internet job and networking sites,  [0m
[33m and, of course, traditional newspaper advertising.  [0m
[33m As you get people applying for the job,  [0m
[33m it's time to start interviewing.  [0m
[33m And I recommend creating an interview script  [0m
[33m that focuses on what reps need to do  [0m
[33m to perform the sales task.  [0m
[33m Sales managers use two types of interview scripts.  [0m
[33m First are called the situation  [0m
[33m or behavior-based interviews.  [0m
[33m If the sales task requires reps  [0m
[33m to respond to certain situations,  [0m
[33m ask interview questions  [0m
[33m that focus on those situations.  [0m
[33m Here's an example of this type of interview question.  [0m
[33m A potential customer just told you  [0m
[33m that you didn't get the order.  [0m
[33m What do you do now?  [0m
[33m And how do you respond?  [0m
[33m With this question,  [0m
[33m you would want to hear that the rep is tactful,  [0m
[33m professional and appreciative  [0m
[33m but they also try to find out the reasons  [0m
[33m why they were not given the business.  [0m
[33m The other approach is performance-based interviews.  [0m
[33m Here you give the candidate exercises  [0m
[33m that simulate a selling situation  [0m
[33m or activity in the sales task.  [0m
[33m For example, you might hand a candidate an everyday product  [0m
[33m and ask them to describe its features and benefits.  [0m
[33m When you find the right candidate,  [0m
[33m make the offer and be ready to negotiate.  [0m
[33m Salespeople want more than anything  [0m
[33m to feel that they are valued.  [0m
[33m Send that message from the very start  [0m
[33m with a fair but strong employment offer.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Conducting sales training[0m

[33m - A formal sales training program  [0m
[33m is one of the best ways  [0m
[33m you can assure success of your sales team.  [0m
[33m Here's how to create one.  [0m
[33m Take your sales task and break it down  [0m
[33m into an exhaustive list of specific skills,  [0m
[33m knowledge, and behaviors they must acquire in training.  [0m
[33m Now, remember you did something similar  [0m
[33m during the recruiting process,  [0m
[33m to create a job description and a hiring template,  [0m
[33m but this time you want to make the lists  [0m
[33m as complete as possible.  [0m
[33m So think of it this way.  [0m
[33m If you hire people with some existing skills,  [0m
[33m knowledge, and behaviors,  [0m
[33m then your training program is designed  [0m
[33m to reinforce those, as well as fill in the gaps.  [0m
[33m You want people walking out of your training program  [0m
[33m ready to perform the sales task.  [0m
[33m So here's an example for a rep selling surgical instruments.  [0m
[33m The skills list would include call planning,  [0m
[33m giving presentations, demonstrating products,  [0m
[33m gaining commitments, and taking orders.  [0m
[33m The knowledge list has human anatomy,  [0m
[33m surgical procedures, operating room protocols,  [0m
[33m and the surgeon profession.  [0m
[33m And finally, the behaviors include self-motivated,  [0m
[33m professional, organized, engaging,  [0m
[33m and, of course, persuasive.  [0m
[33m Now, using these lists create a series of training modules  [0m
[33m design to deliver or reinforce each item.  [0m
[33m To deliver the training, you have a lot of options.  [0m
[33m The most obvious source is to select  [0m
[33m one of your star performing sales reps,  [0m
[33m but be careful here.  [0m
[33m When you take a great rep out of the field to do training,  [0m
[33m it could impact your sales.  [0m
[33m Other options include sales managers,  [0m
[33m marketing managers, your technical teams,  [0m
[33m or even your customers.  [0m
[33m Look at each module and determine  [0m
[33m who is most qualified to do the job.  [0m
[33m In some companies,  [0m
[33m it makes sense to create internal positions  [0m
[33m as sales trainers who do it all.  [0m
[33m You might even consider hiring  [0m
[33m outside sales training specialist.  [0m
[33m Now, most sales training programs  [0m
[33m involve some type of role playing,  [0m
[33m so that reps can practice the exact skills  [0m
[33m expected of them in the field.  [0m
[33m The key is to make training and experience  [0m
[33m that translates directly  [0m
[33m into what they'll have to do in the field.  [0m
[33m Now, where are you delivered training,  [0m
[33m is another key question.  [0m
[33m Consider each module and ask yourself  [0m
[33m what location would make the most impact on learning.  [0m
[33m For example, would it make sense  [0m
[33m to do training in the field?  [0m
[33m Perhaps at a customer's location,  [0m
[33m or at a distributor of your product.  [0m
[33m More and more companies are delivering training online.  [0m
[33m For example, take a look at the variety of sales courses  [0m
[33m here on LinkedIn Learning.  [0m
[33m A sales training program motivates your reps,  [0m
[33m and shows the company's commitment to their success.  [0m
[33m But most importantly,  [0m
[33m it gets them off to a fast start to go out  [0m
[33m and build your business.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Motivating salespeople[0m

[33m - Perhaps the hardest part of the sales job  [0m
[33m is how to stay motivated.  [0m
[33m And that's where you, the sales manager comes in.  [0m
[33m Creating competency means hiring and training  [0m
[33m great salespeople, but it also means keeping them motivated.  [0m
[33m Why motivate?  [0m
[33m Well, it creates enthusiasm for the job  [0m
[33m and reduces job turnover.  [0m
[33m Motivated reps are more productive and more confident  [0m
[33m in their ability to accomplish the sales task.  [0m
[33m Motivated reps get less frustrated and they stay on track  [0m
[33m to get the job done.  [0m
[33m The most successful sales managers use a combination  [0m
[33m of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards to motivate salespeople.  [0m
[33m Intrinsic rewards include giving reps autonomy and freedom  [0m
[33m to do their jobs,  [0m
[33m reminding them that they are selling interesting and useful  [0m
[33m products that help their customers,  [0m
[33m and giving them a sense that the company is loyal to them.  [0m
[33m Extrinsic rewards can be both financial and nonfinancial,  [0m
[33m and these include salary and bonuses,  [0m
[33m sales awards like rings and plaques,  [0m
[33m special titles like senior sales rep  [0m
[33m and just the good old pat on the back.  [0m
[33m Sales reps are very motivated by recognition  [0m
[33m as it reinforces their choice to work hard.  [0m
[33m But sometimes the lack of recognition  [0m
[33m can be just as powerful,  [0m
[33m when a rep sees his colleagues winning sales awards  [0m
[33m and they have it.  [0m
[33m So schedule regular events to recognize successful reps  [0m
[33m in front of others.  [0m
[33m Arrange to have the senior leaders in your company,  [0m
[33m especially the CEO,  [0m
[33m take the time to visit with the top reps and thank them.  [0m
[33m Reps want to feel useful, important, and worthwhile.  [0m
[33m So get them involved in things like your training programs.  [0m
[33m Invite them to important sales planning meetings.  [0m
[33m Have them mentor newly hired sales reps,  [0m
[33m or perhaps ask them to be part of a sales advisory council  [0m
[33m for your company.  [0m
[33m Another great way to motivate sales reps  [0m
[33m is to conduct sales contests.  [0m
[33m Now these are short term incentive programs that award  [0m
[33m prizes to reps that achieve specific sales targets.  [0m
[33m These might include getting new accounts,  [0m
[33m selling certain products or gathering specific types  [0m
[33m of information from the market.  [0m
[33m For many reps, the best motivation of all  [0m
[33m comes from customer feedback.  [0m
[33m It's very powerful because it reminds the rep  [0m
[33m of the direct impact of their efforts.  [0m
[33m So here's a tip.  [0m
[33m Next time you have a sales award meeting,  [0m
[33m invite the winning rep's customer to the event,  [0m
[33m to say a few words about the rep and to personally  [0m
[33m hand over the award.  [0m
[33m Now that will put a smile on the rep's face for sure.  [0m
[33m Oh, and there's another important benefit  [0m
[33m to motivating your sales reps.  [0m
[33m If you selected and train talented salespeople,  [0m
[33m keeping them motivated is the best way  [0m
[33m to assure your success.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m3[0m[33m. Creating a Sales Structure[0m

[33m### Defining a sales force structure[0m

[33m - Creating a sales structure means deciding  [0m
[33m how many sales reps you need and how to organize them.  [0m
[33m There are two ways to decide how many reps you need.  [0m
[33m A top-down approach means you take  [0m
[33m your total annual revenue goal  [0m
[33m and divide it by the average sales per customer.  [0m
[33m For example, if your sales goal is $[0m[1;33m1[0m[33m million,  [0m
[33m and the average sales is $[0m[1;33m1[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m dollars, and you need to  [0m
[33m call on these customers at least five times a year,  [0m
[33m well, then you need to have enough reps  [0m
[33m to make [0m[1;33m5[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m sales calls.  [0m
[33m If the average rep can make [0m[1;33m500[0m[33m calls per year,  [0m
[33m which is about two per day,  [0m
[33m then you'll need at least [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m sales reps.  [0m
[33m The other approach is from the bottom up.  [0m
[33m Look at the total number of customers or accounts you have  [0m
[33m in your geographic area, decide how many calls  [0m
[33m you need to make on each one to generate a sale.  [0m
[33m For example, if you have [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m customers in your area,  [0m
[33m and they need to be called on five times a year,  [0m
[33m well, that means your sales team needs to do [0m[1;33m5[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m calls.  [0m
[33m And then just like before, divide that by the total number  [0m
[33m of calls one rep can make in a year.  [0m
[33m That gives you the total number of reps needed to cover  [0m
[33m all those customers in that geographic area.  [0m
[33m And as before, if the average rep can make [0m[1;33m500[0m[33m calls  [0m
[33m per year, you'll need at least [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m reps to cover this area.  [0m
[33m Once you've decided on the number of reps,  [0m
[33m you need to decide how to organize them.  [0m
[33m Do you want them to be product focused,  [0m
[33m customer focused, or geographic focused?  [0m
[33m Now here's a nice tool to help you decide.  [0m
[33m It's a matrix that pairs the products you have  [0m
[33m with the types of customers you have.  [0m
[33m For each combination, you decide on the sales task.  [0m
[33m So for example, sales task A1 describes what a rep does  [0m
[33m to sell product A to customer type one.  [0m
[33m Let's use our medical example.  [0m
[33m Let's assume we sell diagnostic products,  [0m
[33m surgical instruments, and medical supplies.  [0m
[33m And we want to reach hospitals, clinics,  [0m
[33m and doctor's offices.  [0m
[33m The sales task would be defined  [0m
[33m for each of these combinations.  [0m
[33m Now look closely at the sales task in each column.  [0m
[33m If columns are similar, then you organize by product.  [0m
[33m For example, if sales tasks A1, A2, and A3 are the same,  [0m
[33m you would want to create sales reps who just specialize  [0m
[33m on selling diagnostic equipment to all types of accounts.  [0m
[33m Now look across the rows.  [0m
[33m For example, if sales tasks A1, B1, and C1 are the same,  [0m
[33m you would want to create sales reps who specialize  [0m
[33m just on hospitals, selling all three types of products.  [0m
[33m So what do you do if all the sales tasks  [0m
[33m in the entire matrix are the same?  [0m
[33m Well, then you organize your reps by geography.  [0m
[33m All reps sell all products to all account types  [0m
[33m in your entire area.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Forecasting sales performance[0m

[33m - To create territories, you first need to forecast  [0m
[33m both the market potential  [0m
[33m and the sales potential in your areas.  [0m
[33m Market potential is what you and all the companies like you  [0m
[33m expect to sell in that area.  [0m
[33m It's the potential sales  [0m
[33m for your entire industry in that area.  [0m
[33m Sales potential, on the other hand,  [0m
[33m is what your company expects to earn  [0m
[33m out of that total market potential.  [0m
[33m In other words, it's your share of the market.  [0m
[33m Now, forecasts can be based on  [0m
[33m objective data or subjective data.  [0m
[33m Objective methods look at past historical data  [0m
[33m as an indicator of future performance.  [0m
[33m For example, you might look  [0m
[33m at the last several years of company sales,  [0m
[33m and this would tell you if the company's sales  [0m
[33m are growing, staying flat, or perhaps declining.  [0m
[33m And based on that, you'll have to decide  [0m
[33m where those trends will continue,  [0m
[33m or if there is something you're planning to do  [0m
[33m that will change those trends.  [0m
[33m Subjective techniques are based on the opinions of experts.  [0m
[33m Now, these could be individuals or groups  [0m
[33m responding to a survey,  [0m
[33m or perhaps in face-to-face interviews.  [0m
[33m These experts might be your customers,  [0m
[33m your sales reps, or perhaps your distributors.  [0m
[33m Once you decide on the sources of data for your forecast,  [0m
[33m you need to decide on what approach to use.  [0m
[33m And two options I recommend  [0m
[33m are the top-down approach and the bottom up approach.  [0m
[33m With the top-down approach,  [0m
[33m you start at the national economic level  [0m
[33m to assess the overall condition of the economy.  [0m
[33m Is the economy growing or shrinking?  [0m
[33m Why you ask?  [0m
[33m Well, it can affect sales in your particular industry.  [0m
[33m Next, look at your industry potential.  [0m
[33m Are there factors affecting your industry  [0m
[33m positively or negatively?  [0m
[33m Are there new foreign competitors or new regulations  [0m
[33m that might hurt sales?  [0m
[33m From there, estimate your share of the industry pie.  [0m
[33m That is your company's sales potential  [0m
[33m that you will break down further into territories.  [0m
[33m Now, the bottom-up approach is just the opposite.  [0m
[33m With this approach, you start by asking each sales rep  [0m
[33m to estimate how much their territory might produce overall  [0m
[33m given the number of customers,  [0m
[33m how loyal those customers are,  [0m
[33m and how strong the competition is.  [0m
[33m You take all the territory forecast  [0m
[33m roll them up to a company level sales potential.  [0m
[33m Now, to learn how to do both of these approaches,  [0m
[33m see my course, Sales Forecasting, here on LinkedIn Learning.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Creating sales territories[0m

[33m - To create sales territories, I recommend two approaches.  [0m
[33m The buildup method or the breakdown method.  [0m
[33m It's a little bit like the forecasting methods  [0m
[33m of top down and bottom up.  [0m
[33m With the buildup method,  [0m
[33m you start at the level of the individual rep  [0m
[33m to understand their workload capacity  [0m
[33m and how frequently they need to call on customers  [0m
[33m to succeed.  [0m
[33m Here are the steps.  [0m
[33m You start with the sales task.  [0m
[33m What kinds of customers are we calling on,  [0m
[33m and how many of them are there in our area?  [0m
[33m What products or services are we selling?  [0m
[33m And given that, what does a rep need to do with customers  [0m
[33m to generate a sale, and how long does that take?  [0m
[33m Let's go back to our medical device example from before.  [0m
[33m We're selling diagnostic machines to hospitals,  [0m
[33m clinics, and doctor's offices.  [0m
[33m And there are about [0m[1;33m1000[0m[33m of them in our area.  [0m
[33m Well, given the complexity of selling this equipment,  [0m
[33m reps need to spend a lot of time during each sales call.  [0m
[33m Given how spread out customers are,  [0m
[33m our reps can call on about two per day,  [0m
[33m or about [0m[1;33m500[0m[33m calls per year.  [0m
[33m We did the same calculations  [0m
[33m when deciding on how many reps to hire.  [0m
[33m Now, we need to draw a geographical boundary for each rep,  [0m
[33m so that each of them have about [0m[1;33m100[0m[33m of these customers.  [0m
[33m The breakdown method is the opposite.  [0m
[33m Look at your forecast for overall company sales potential,  [0m
[33m then divide that by the number of reps you have.  [0m
[33m That's what's expected of each rep.  [0m
[33m And then, you create geographical territories  [0m
[33m with this level of sales volume.  [0m
[33m Now, here are some tips when creating sales territories.  [0m
[33m First, try to use geographical boundaries  [0m
[33m that already exist.  [0m
[33m You can create sales territories  [0m
[33m around existing state boundaries.  [0m
[33m For example, you might create a territory  [0m
[33m that includes all the states in New England.  [0m
[33m You can also use county, city, or even zip code boundaries.  [0m
[33m This makes it perfectly clear  [0m
[33m where a rep is supposed to sell,  [0m
[33m and where they are not supposed to sell,  [0m
[33m and where they might interfere with another rep.  [0m
[33m Now, not every territory will be the same size and shape.  [0m
[33m Rather, you're trying to create equal territories  [0m
[33m in terms of sales potential, not physical size.  [0m
[33m Be sure your financial and IT systems are set up  [0m
[33m so they capture sales based on customers  [0m
[33m in these geographical boundaries.  [0m
[33m You need to measure results at the territory level  [0m
[33m to assess progress.  [0m
[33m And finally, be prepared  [0m
[33m to change territory boundaries often.  [0m
[33m Hey, market conditions change, your reps change,  [0m
[33m and competition changes.  [0m
[33m Expanding or contracting the size of a territory  [0m
[33m is another dowel that you as a sales manager have  [0m
[33m to get results.  [0m
[33m Well designed sales territories  [0m
[33m can make your customers happier,  [0m
[33m reduce selling and travel costs,  [0m
[33m and keep your reps motivated and productive.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Setting sales quotas[0m

[33m - A sales quota is a target amount  [0m
[33m that reps are expected to sell.  [0m
[33m Quotas are an important sales management tool.  [0m
[33m Setting quotas links the sales rep directly  [0m
[33m to the firm's strategy and to the sales task.  [0m
[33m They help focus resources on high potential areas.  [0m
[33m But most importantly, quotas motivate.  [0m
[33m Let's look at how you do it.  [0m
[33m Step one is to collect data.  [0m
[33m Look at each territory's potential market sales  [0m
[33m versus the rep's sales history.  [0m
[33m Be sure to gather data for a time period  [0m
[33m that is comparable to the quota setting period.  [0m
[33m One year, for example.  [0m
[33m You need to assess whether the rep is at, above  [0m
[33m or below the potential of the territory.  [0m
[33m Are they selling what you would expect given that potential?  [0m
[33m The next step is to understand territory differences.  [0m
[33m Not all territories are created equally.  [0m
[33m And when you design the territories,  [0m
[33m you should have noted things  [0m
[33m like different economic conditions,  [0m
[33m the competitive situation, and travel times  [0m
[33m within the territory.  [0m
[33m Now, with this information,  [0m
[33m it's time to set a quota for each rep,  [0m
[33m but adjusted upward or downward based on current penetration  [0m
[33m and individual rep ability.  [0m
[33m For example, in low penetrated areas,  [0m
[33m you might ask the rep to get more growth next year,  [0m
[33m but if your company already has high penetration,  [0m
[33m meaning a high market share,  [0m
[33m it would be appropriate to keep the quota flat for that rep.  [0m
[33m After all, there's just not enough new business for the rep  [0m
[33m to capture if you already have most of it.  [0m
[33m Now, not every rep will have the same quota  [0m
[33m or the same level of difficulty achieving the quota,  [0m
[33m so your most talented performing reps should be expected  [0m
[33m to produce more.  [0m
[33m Reps in shrinking territories will be expected  [0m
[33m to produce less.  [0m
[33m Setting quotas is a bit of an art backed by good data  [0m
[33m and even better judgment.  [0m
[33m That's why it's critical to do a reality check here.  [0m
[33m Does the quota seem fair and reasonable?  [0m
[33m Will it motivate the rep  [0m
[33m or is there a chance it might backfire and cause the rep  [0m
[33m to just give up because it's set too high?  [0m
[33m And finally, you need to communicate the quota to the rep,  [0m
[33m make quotas clear  [0m
[33m and thoroughly explain how the quotas were determined.  [0m
[33m Also be sure to announce the quotas  [0m
[33m prior to the effective time period.  [0m
[33m Quotas are so important because they send a key signal  [0m
[33m to your rep.  [0m
[33m And that signal is how much confidence you have  [0m
[33m in their ability to succeed.  [0m
[33m Quotas are like a contract between the sales manager  [0m
[33m and the rep.  [0m
[33m So set them carefully to support your team  [0m
[33m and see the results you're looking for.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m4[0m[33m. Managing Sales Teams[0m

[33m### Understanding sales compensation[0m

[33m - To create and manage an effective sales force,  [0m
[33m you must compensate your reps.  [0m
[33m The good news is that sales managers have a variety  [0m
[33m of sales compensation schemes to use.  [0m
[33m The key is to select one that is market-competitive  [0m
[33m and that drives the right behaviors in your sales reps.  [0m
[33m Compensation can affect  [0m
[33m the number of sales calls a rep makes,  [0m
[33m the quality of that sales call,  [0m
[33m and how much time a rep devotes to the job.  [0m
[33m It all depends, once again, on the sales task.  [0m
[33m Who do we call on?  [0m
[33m What products do we sell?  [0m
[33m What activities lead to success?  [0m
[33m And what interactions do reps have  [0m
[33m with others in the company?  [0m
[33m In other words, compensation can drive behavior  [0m
[33m in all four areas of the sales task.  [0m
[33m Now, creating a sales comp program takes a lot of work,  [0m
[33m so it's important to get help from others  [0m
[33m within your company.  [0m
[33m such as your finance and human resource departments.  [0m
[33m A good sales comp program is simple, fair,  [0m
[33m flexible, affordable, and, most of all, competitive.  [0m
[33m To design a sales compensation plan,  [0m
[33m start by looking at your current comp program  [0m
[33m and determine how well it's working.  [0m
[33m What are its strengths and weaknesses?  [0m
[33m Is the comp plan aligned  [0m
[33m with the strategic direction of the firm?  [0m
[33m Is the plan affordable  [0m
[33m within your overall company's business model?  [0m
[33m Is it competitive with other firms that you compete with?  [0m
[33m Is the program too volatile  [0m
[33m in terms of how reps make their money?  [0m
[33m Be sure to get diverse input when you do this assessment.  [0m
[33m You should get feedback from your senior management,  [0m
[33m your sales teams, and sales support groups,  [0m
[33m but also include feedback  [0m
[33m from marketing and other departments,  [0m
[33m especially ones that are directly impacted  [0m
[33m by the activities of sales reps,  [0m
[33m such as your manufacturing team or customer service groups.  [0m
[33m You should also assess how simple and easy it is  [0m
[33m to administer the current plan.  [0m
[33m Are there ways to streamline it  [0m
[33m and make it an even more efficient part  [0m
[33m of your overall sales management toolkit?  [0m
[33m What can you do to make it more flexible and nimble?  [0m
[33m A great sales compensation plan  [0m
[33m links all aspects of sales management.  [0m
[33m The best sales managers are the ones that take the time  [0m
[33m to design the right one for their company.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Designing sales compensation programs[0m

[33m - To design a sales compensation program,  [0m
[33m follow these four steps.  [0m
[33m First, determine how much you want each rep to earn.  [0m
[33m Second, determine the method you will use  [0m
[33m to compensate them.  [0m
[33m Third, set thresholds around the target compensation,  [0m
[33m and finally, test your program before you put it into place.  [0m
[33m So first let's discuss how to determine  [0m
[33m the total amount of money you want your sales reps  [0m
[33m to earn annually.  [0m
[33m Take a look at their past performance  [0m
[33m and decide if you want to make adjustments  [0m
[33m up or down to that total for the coming year.  [0m
[33m For example, you might add in a cost of living adjustment.  [0m
[33m Make sure the amount you pay is competitive  [0m
[33m with the rest of the industry.  [0m
[33m Next, determine the method you want to use to pay your reps.  [0m
[33m You could use a straight salary program,  [0m
[33m a variable commission program, or a combination of the two.  [0m
[33m Straight salary programs are simple,  [0m
[33m easy to administer and control  [0m
[33m and easy to tie to the sales task,  [0m
[33m but there's no incentive to work beyond what is expected.  [0m
[33m Variable commission plans are great  [0m
[33m because they're directly linked to the sales generated.  [0m
[33m The more you sell, the more you earn,  [0m
[33m but that creates a lot of risk for the sales employee.  [0m
[33m Their income can be erratic and that makes it tough  [0m
[33m to pay the bills each month,  [0m
[33m so most companies use a combination.  [0m
[33m A combination program works by giving a rep a base salary  [0m
[33m of say [0m[1;33m75[0m[33m% of their projected target earnings.  [0m
[33m And then they have to earn the remaining portion  [0m
[33m of their salary from commissions.  [0m
[33m They may earn less, the same as,  [0m
[33m or well above the targeted salary.  [0m
[33m It's all up to how hard they want to work.  [0m
[33m Combination programs give you the best of both worlds,  [0m
[33m the security and stability of having a base salary  [0m
[33m plus a strong incentive to achieve more  [0m
[33m and accomplish the sales task.  [0m
[33m The next step is to set thresholds on how the rep  [0m
[33m earns the variable portion of their income.  [0m
[33m You could pay a straight dollar amount  [0m
[33m or a percentage of sales on each unit sold,  [0m
[33m or you could vary the payments  [0m
[33m based on reaching certain quotas.  [0m
[33m Here's an example.  [0m
[33m Let's imagine a medical device rep gets paid $[0m[1;33m3[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m  [0m
[33m on each diagnostic machine sold for the first [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m units,  [0m
[33m but then that amount increases to $[0m[1;33m5[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m  [0m
[33m when she sells units [0m[1;33m11[0m[33m to [0m[1;33m20[0m[33m.  [0m
[33m Boy, that gives her a lot more incentive  [0m
[33m to sell that first [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m units.  [0m
[33m Finally, you need to test your comp program  [0m
[33m before you implement it.  [0m
[33m Here's a tip, take your new program  [0m
[33m and run it through last year's actual sales results  [0m
[33m to see how each rep would have been paid  [0m
[33m under the new program, and then ask yourself,  [0m
[33m will each rep earn what you want them to?  [0m
[33m Will the new program drive the desired behaviors?  [0m
[33m Is there enough upside and downside for the rep  [0m
[33m to really motivate them?  [0m
[33m And did you get the right split between fixed salary  [0m
[33m and variable commission?  [0m
[33m Most importantly, is the new program simple  [0m
[33m and easy to understand?  [0m
[33m A well-designed sales compensation program  [0m
[33m links all the elements of sales management,  [0m
[33m the sales task, the structure of your territories and quotas  [0m
[33m and how you motivate a competent sales team.  [0m
[33m Now that's a recipe for success.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Communicating sales compensation[0m

[33m - The best compensation plan can fail  [0m
[33m if not properly communicated.  [0m
[33m It's essential that your sales employees  [0m
[33m know exactly how and when they will be paid.  [0m
[33m To make sure you get it right,  [0m
[33m I recommend creating a formal written document  [0m
[33m that describes how the plan works,  [0m
[33m how it compares to industry market rates,  [0m
[33m and the method and timing of how reps earn their money.  [0m
[33m Be sure to include examples.  [0m
[33m Reps will share this information with their partner.  [0m
[33m So it's essential the family fully understands  [0m
[33m [0m[1;33m([0m[33mlaughing[0m[1;33m)[0m[33m  [0m
[33m how the income is coming in.  [0m
[33m By the way,  [0m
[33m make sure you coordinate that written document  [0m
[33m with your finance and human resources departments  [0m
[33m to make sure the pay plan is in the budget  [0m
[33m and that it complies with HR policies.  [0m
[33m Along with a written pay plan,  [0m
[33m I also recommend doing verbal presentations.  [0m
[33m Start by announcing the pay plan to the entire sales force,  [0m
[33m and then follow up with one-on-one meetings  [0m
[33m between the manager and the rep.  [0m
[33m You may have to deal with special situations,  [0m
[33m such as when a rep's compensation is likely to drop  [0m
[33m under the new plan.  [0m
[33m They need to know why.  [0m
[33m Individual meetings help you reinforce the message  [0m
[33m of what you expect, and how the comp plan is tied  [0m
[33m to the sales task and their quotas for the year.  [0m
[33m Now, after you communicate it,  [0m
[33m it's time to put the plan in place.  [0m
[33m The best compensation plan can also fail  [0m
[33m if not properly administered.  [0m
[33m Here are some key success factors.  [0m
[33m Be sure to give continuous feedback to each rep  [0m
[33m on how they're earning under the new plan,  [0m
[33m include clear documentation on the calculations used  [0m
[33m to figure out their earnings.  [0m
[33m It's critical that you pay reps with strict adherence  [0m
[33m to the defined pay schedules,  [0m
[33m and that you resolve any mistakes or issues in compensation.  [0m
[33m A rep's motivation will drop  [0m
[33m if they aren't paid the right amount and on time.  [0m
[33m Now be sure to measure how the compensation plan is working.  [0m
[33m What were the objectives?  [0m
[33m What metrics tell you if these objectives are being met?  [0m
[33m Is it sales, profits, or market share?  [0m
[33m And what are the actual results of those metrics  [0m
[33m versus the plan?  [0m
[33m Finally is the plan as simple as expected?  [0m
[33m It's essential that you measure continuously.  [0m
[33m Hey, just waiting until the end of the year,  [0m
[33m only to find out that the plan wasn't quite working  [0m
[33m is unacceptable.  [0m
[33m Great sales managers are proactive in everything they do,  [0m
[33m especially in keeping track of how their reps  [0m
[33m are getting paid.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Managing underperforming reps[0m

[33m - All sales managers will face the situation  [0m
[33m where a rep is just not performing.  [0m
[33m Even with the best compensation and reward system in place,  [0m
[33m a few of your reps won't get the job done.  [0m
[33m So here are the steps to dealing  [0m
[33m with underperforming sales employees.  [0m
[33m First, look at the data  [0m
[33m about your team's overall performance.  [0m
[33m Look at sales call reports and sales results.  [0m
[33m Are the reps going to the right accounts  [0m
[33m and doing the right things in those accounts?  [0m
[33m Are you getting complaints from customers or other people  [0m
[33m that suggest there may be a problem?  [0m
[33m Then you need to diagnose why a particular rep  [0m
[33m is underperforming.  [0m
[33m In my experience, there are only two reasons for it.  [0m
[33m They don't know how to perform the sales task,  [0m
[33m or they don't want to.  [0m
[33m They lack the skill or the will.  [0m
[33m Let's look at each one.  [0m
[33m If a rep doesn't know how to do the job,  [0m
[33m it might be due to a lack of training.  [0m
[33m So in this case, go back to your sales competency model  [0m
[33m that outlines the skills, knowledge,  [0m
[33m and behaviors needed to succeed in this job.  [0m
[33m Go through each one and assess where that rep is lacking.  [0m
[33m Then work with your training department or your HR group  [0m
[33m to create a customized remedial training program  [0m
[33m to get that rep back up to speed.  [0m
[33m Now here's a tip.  [0m
[33m Be sure that the rep is fully on board with the assessment  [0m
[33m of where they need help, and that they're fully committed  [0m
[33m to closing the gap.  [0m
[33m Hey, if not, you'll continue to see weak performance  [0m
[33m out of that rep down the road.  [0m
[33m Another simple reason for a poor performance  [0m
[33m is that the sales task has changed  [0m
[33m and the rep didn't hear about it.  [0m
[33m So in that case, sit down with the rep,  [0m
[33m go through the sales task in detail,  [0m
[33m and perhaps schedule a sales call with the rep  [0m
[33m so you can see how they're performing it firsthand.  [0m
[33m Now, a harder situation to deal with  [0m
[33m is when a rep knows the job, but is still not performing.  [0m
[33m They're just not working hard enough to get the job done.  [0m
[33m Here again, there could be a lot of reasons for that.  [0m
[33m It might be a pay issue.  [0m
[33m Or perhaps they're just not motivated day to day  [0m
[33m to do the work.  [0m
[33m Or maybe they have a personal problem at home.  [0m
[33m So as their manager, you need to help them  [0m
[33m turn the situation around.  [0m
[33m But be sure to set limits and deadlines  [0m
[33m on when you and the rep will agree  [0m
[33m that the issue is resolved  [0m
[33m and that performance will improve.  [0m
[33m If those deadlines aren't met,  [0m
[33m you'll need to find a new rep for that territory.  [0m
[33m Managing salespeople is a rewarding  [0m
[33m but sometimes challenging leadership role,  [0m
[33m especially when you consider that every rep is different,  [0m
[33m each has their own skill levels,  [0m
[33m and each has their own ambitions and career direction.  [0m
[33m That's why skilled managers don't manage the team  [0m
[33m as a group, rather they manage it one person at a time.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Measuring sales performance[0m

[33m - Sales managers hold their team members accountable  [0m
[33m for achieving results given the sales task.  [0m
[33m But to do that, you first have to measure results.  [0m
[33m Here's how, first, be sure to measure  [0m
[33m both the outputs of your sales rep, as well as the inputs.  [0m
[33m The outputs include things like their sales revenue,  [0m
[33m number of units sold, gross margin,  [0m
[33m and number of new accounts.  [0m
[33m Inputs are the rep's activities  [0m
[33m that go into achieving the sales task.  [0m
[33m These include things like the number of calls  [0m
[33m they make each day, the number of days worked,  [0m
[33m the actual selling time per call,  [0m
[33m as well as things like the number of phone calls made  [0m
[33m to prospective clients.  [0m
[33m Inputs are what the reps do to generate outputs.  [0m
[33m But the most effective way to measure it  [0m
[33m is to look at the ratios of the inputs and the outputs.  [0m
[33m Here's an example.  [0m
[33m Imagine you're evaluating two sales reps.  [0m
[33m One of them has made [0m[1;33m100[0m[33m sales calls this month  [0m
[33m and the other has made only [0m[1;33m90[0m[33m.  [0m
[33m So which rep is doing the better job?  [0m
[33m Well, if you look at just the total calls,  [0m
[33m it would appear the first rep is working harder.  [0m
[33m But when you consider the number of days worked,  [0m
[33m the picture changes.  [0m
[33m You should compare the ratio of sales calls worked  [0m
[33m divided by the number of days worked.  [0m
[33m Look at this example.  [0m
[33m Rep A makes [0m[1;33m100[0m[33m calls in [0m[1;33m20[0m[33m days,  [0m
[33m which equals five calls per day.  [0m
[33m But Rep B does [0m[1;33m90[0m[33m calls in only [0m[1;33m15[0m[33m days,  [0m
[33m so that equals six calls per day.  [0m
[33m Now, viewed this way, Rep B is working harder.  [0m
[33m Now here's a tip.  [0m
[33m Look at your sales task and create a ratio of outputs  [0m
[33m divided by inputs for each activity.  [0m
[33m Look at this example of how these ratios can be used  [0m
[33m to create a sales effectiveness index.  [0m
[33m Sales effectiveness index equals the calls  [0m
[33m divided by days worked times orders divided by calls  [0m
[33m times sales divided by orders.  [0m
[33m When you evaluate your reps using this index,  [0m
[33m you're going to see exactly who's getting the most output  [0m
[33m for the amount of input they make to the job.  [0m
[33m Now, don't just measure something  [0m
[33m because you happen to have the data.  [0m
[33m Your reps might feel you're micro-managing  [0m
[33m if you measure an activity,  [0m
[33m but don't expect them to do anything differently  [0m
[33m because of it.  [0m
[33m Measure the things that matter.  [0m
[33m Also, be sure to measure continuously.  [0m
[33m Don't wait until the end of the year  [0m
[33m to find out something is wrong.  [0m
[33m Do it as often as you can to take corrective action.  [0m
[33m Also, make sure reps know how they're being evaluated.  [0m
[33m Hey, don't surprise them with something you're measuring  [0m
[33m and they're not even aware of it.  [0m
[33m You'll lose their trust.  [0m
[33m Finally, be sure to set standards of performance.  [0m
[33m Don't measure something and tell them  [0m
[33m they've done a good job or a bad job  [0m
[33m if there were no criteria to assess them.  [0m
[33m The best sales managers know  [0m
[33m that it's really all about the conversations you have  [0m
[33m with the reps that matter most.  [0m
[33m Measurements of performance are just an indicator.  [0m
[33m When you combine thoughtful conversation  [0m
[33m with good, accurate data about their work,  [0m
[33m it shows the rep that you care about helping them succeed.  [0m
[33m And that's the most rewarding part  [0m
[33m of the sales manager's job.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m5[0m[33m. Managing Sales Virtually[0m

[33m### Creating the virtual sales task[0m

[33m - Sales managers must be adaptive and flexible  [0m
[33m to changes in the marketplace.  [0m
[33m And given today's new work environment,  [0m
[33m this is more true than ever.  [0m
[33m As with everything else in sales management,  [0m
[33m it starts with the sales task,  [0m
[33m which is your playbook for success.  [0m
[33m Let's look at how to take your current sales task  [0m
[33m and update it to include more components that are virtual.  [0m
[33m There are four questions you answer  [0m
[33m to define the sales task.  [0m
[33m First, which customers are we going after?  [0m
[33m Now, in a virtual world,  [0m
[33m you and your marketing colleagues may want to revise  [0m
[33m how you think about the customers you go after.  [0m
[33m Virtual sales calls may give you more access  [0m
[33m to different types of customers, for example.  [0m
[33m Next, you decide what products  [0m
[33m and services you want the team to sell.  [0m
[33m Now, this probably won't change too much,  [0m
[33m but you may find that you're able to provide a new level  [0m
[33m of sales support using virtual technologies.  [0m
[33m And if so, you should include that  [0m
[33m as part of your sales task.  [0m
[33m The third part of the sales task  [0m
[33m defines exactly what activities must be accomplished  [0m
[33m to sell a product to a customer.  [0m
[33m How many calls do you want your sales reps to make  [0m
[33m to each customer?  [0m
[33m And what do you want them to do  [0m
[33m when they meet with a customer?  [0m
[33m This is the part that really matters,  [0m
[33m and you should take your time thinking this through.  [0m
[33m Selling virtually may also help the reps be more efficient  [0m
[33m because they don't have to drive to a customer location.  [0m
[33m The sales task should be changed  [0m
[33m to reflect how many virtual calls you want reps to make.  [0m
[33m But also ask, what can and cannot be accomplished  [0m
[33m in a virtual sales environment  [0m
[33m versus the traditional in-person environment?  [0m
[33m You may find, for example,  [0m
[33m that some parts of the selling process  [0m
[33m could be done virtually  [0m
[33m while others must be done in person.  [0m
[33m For example, if a salesperson does product demonstrations  [0m
[33m on a customer job site,  [0m
[33m that might be impossible to do well on a Zoom call.  [0m
[33m So in this case, the sales task should reflect  [0m
[33m this new blended approach to selling.  [0m
[33m And finally, what departments  [0m
[33m within the company do you want your reps to call  [0m
[33m when they need support?  [0m
[33m Now, with virtual communications, reps may be tempted  [0m
[33m to reach people they might not have called on before.  [0m
[33m So you need to put in strict guidance in the sales task  [0m
[33m about who they can contact for support.  [0m
[33m The key is not to let your reps take precious selling time  [0m
[33m and use it for calls to headquarters.  [0m
[33m I mean, networking is fine,  [0m
[33m but make sure they use good judgment.  [0m
[33m Who do we target? What do we sell?  [0m
[33m How do we sell it?  [0m
[33m And where do we go for support?  [0m
[33m With the new world of work and virtual technologies,  [0m
[33m you have more opportunities than ever  [0m
[33m to create an effective sales task.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Conducting virtual competency programs[0m

[33m - If you include any virtual components in your sales task,  [0m
[33m you'll need to make sure your reps are highly skilled  [0m
[33m at using virtual technologies.  [0m
[33m Now, you might be thinking, "Hey, what's the big deal?  [0m
[33m Everyone knows how to use Zoom or Teams.  [0m
[33m Just turn on your webcam and go, right?"  [0m
[33m Well, not so fast.  [0m
[33m In the professional world of sales,  [0m
[33m this approach won't cut it.  [0m
[33m Here's why, if you set high standards for your sales reps  [0m
[33m when they meet the clients in person,  [0m
[33m you will want to set the same or even higher standards  [0m
[33m for when they meet clients virtually.  [0m
[33m Here's what that looks like.  [0m
[33m First is appearance.  [0m
[33m If reps wear a suit and tie to a client location,  [0m
[33m I believe you want them looking the same onscreen.  [0m
[33m That level of dress brings a sense of credibility  [0m
[33m and expertise, and the rep will lose this  [0m
[33m if he or she just wears the casual home clothes.  [0m
[33m Next is technology.  [0m
[33m Make sure your reps have good quality web cameras,  [0m
[33m microphones, and internet speed.  [0m
[33m Teach them how to look and sound  [0m
[33m as professional as possible.  [0m
[33m Make sure they use appropriate lighting  [0m
[33m so they look natural.  [0m
[33m That means no open windows directly behind them,  [0m
[33m or they'll get too much glare on the screen, not good.  [0m
[33m Give reps a checklist of what to do  [0m
[33m to create their virtual selling studio.  [0m
[33m They need a quiet location with good acoustics.  [0m
[33m They need to elevate their laptop or webcam  [0m
[33m so that it's an eye level.  [0m
[33m They want to be looking straight into the eyes of the client  [0m
[33m as much as possible.  [0m
[33m Be sure reps know how to use a proper background  [0m
[33m on their screens that has the company logo.  [0m
[33m No, not a scene from their recent vacation.  [0m
[33m Reps should learn proper etiquette on Zoom calls,  [0m
[33m meaning no eating, no multitasking,  [0m
[33m and no pets or kids running around the room.  [0m
[33m Finally, reps need to practice good sales call planning  [0m
[33m for a virtual call just as they would for an in-person call.  [0m
[33m Be prepared to show documents using screen-sharing,  [0m
[33m manage time effectively, and do the activities  [0m
[33m that are called for in the sales task.  [0m
[33m Virtual sales calling is both an opportunity and a risk.  [0m
[33m Good sales managers don't leave it to chance  [0m
[33m that reps will just figure it out.  [0m
[33m Instead, give them proper training  [0m
[33m and motivation to do an outstanding job.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Creating virtual territories[0m

[33m - Territories define the scope and domain  [0m
[33m where each sales rep can sell.  [0m
[33m Now typically, territories are based  [0m
[33m around a geographical definition,  [0m
[33m but with the new world at work  [0m
[33m and so much of what we do being virtual,  [0m
[33m those territory boundaries can be anywhere.  [0m
[33m There are lots of possibilities and lots of benefits.  [0m
[33m To create virtual territories,  [0m
[33m you start the same way as creating a geographical territory.  [0m
[33m First, look at your virtual sales task  [0m
[33m and understand how many virtual sales call a rep can make  [0m
[33m in a day.  [0m
[33m Wow, that will be a huge change given that you're taking  [0m
[33m out the driving time between customer locations.  [0m
[33m Reps can make more virtual calls per day than in-person.  [0m
[33m Let's use our medical device example from before.  [0m
[33m We're selling diagnostic machines to hospitals, clinics  [0m
[33m and doctor's offices.  [0m
[33m And let's say there are about a thousand  [0m
[33m of these customers across the country.  [0m
[33m And they need to be called on five times a year.  [0m
[33m Well, that means your sales team needs  [0m
[33m to do [0m[1;33m5[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m calls.  [0m
[33m With in person sales calls,  [0m
[33m your reps can make two calls per day,  [0m
[33m but virtually they can now make four calls per day.  [0m
[33m That's a whopping [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m calls per year per rep,  [0m
[33m instead of only [0m[1;33m500[0m[33m calls in person.  [0m
[33m That means you need only five reps instead of [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m  [0m
[33m from the previous example.  [0m
[33m But here's the cool part.  [0m
[33m Each rep now has [0m[1;33m200[0m[33m accounts  [0m
[33m and those accounts can be located anywhere in the world.  [0m
[33m Geographical boundaries are out the window.  [0m
[33m Now that sounds great,  [0m
[33m but here are some important things to consider  [0m
[33m before you jump right in to virtual territories.  [0m
[33m First, I recommend you take it slowly  [0m
[33m and phase in a more virtual approach rather  [0m
[33m than all at once.  [0m
[33m That gives customers and your reps time to adjust  [0m
[33m to this new sales pattern.  [0m
[33m You don't want anyone upset  [0m
[33m with the lack of in-person contact.  [0m
[33m In fact,  [0m
[33m you may want to use a hybrid approach  [0m
[33m where the rep still visits the customer every month,  [0m
[33m or perhaps every quarter.  [0m
[33m Second, don't get too carried away with virtual territories  [0m
[33m that are spread all over the country.  [0m
[33m I suggest you keep reps calling customers  [0m
[33m in the same time zone, for example.  [0m
[33m It may be helpful to keep reps calling virtually,  [0m
[33m but in the same general geographic region.  [0m
[33m That way, they learn about the customers,  [0m
[33m who they compete with and so on.  [0m
[33m And customers will appreciate  [0m
[33m when the rep is still a hometown supplier  [0m
[33m who understands their regional culture.  [0m
[33m Next, be sure to carefully measure results,  [0m
[33m especially customer satisfaction.  [0m
[33m You want reps to achieve the sales task,  [0m
[33m but not at the expense of angry customers.  [0m
[33m Hey, as a manager,  [0m
[33m be sure to join reps  [0m
[33m on their virtual sales calls periodically,  [0m
[33m to track how things are going.  [0m
[33m A virtual ride along can be just as effective  [0m
[33m as the in-person one.  [0m
[33m And finally, make sure you involve the right people  [0m
[33m inside your company to make this new virtual approach work.  [0m
[33m For example, your IT department may need  [0m
[33m to completely redesign sales reporting  [0m
[33m because they can't use customer zip codes anymore.  [0m
[33m Your supply chain team may have to adapt  [0m
[33m how they ship products,  [0m
[33m given the different selling patterns.  [0m
[33m Virtual sales territories have lots of benefits,  [0m
[33m but as with other aspects of sales management,  [0m
[33m it'll take good leadership and collaboration  [0m
[33m on your part to make it happen.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## Conclusion[0m

[33m### Continuing your sales management journey[0m

[33m - Sales managers are highly sought after  [0m
[33m because of their ability to manage one  [0m
[33m of the company's most important assets,  [0m
[33m it's sales force.  [0m
[33m The most effective sales managers  [0m
[33m generate the most effective sales results.  [0m
[33m For many companies, the first line sales manager  [0m
[33m is the most important job in the company.  [0m
[33m So here are some guidelines  [0m
[33m on how to continue developing your career  [0m
[33m in sales management.  [0m
[33m When I give career advice,  [0m
[33m I remind people to never let a year go by  [0m
[33m without developing some part of your professional skillset.  [0m
[33m First, look for opportunities to broaden your skills  [0m
[33m and experience.  [0m
[33m I believe the first move you should make  [0m
[33m outside of sales management is a position in marketing  [0m
[33m as either a product manager, market development manager,  [0m
[33m or perhaps a role in new product development.  [0m
[33m You need to learn how a company develops strategy,  [0m
[33m how it identifies new opportunities  [0m
[33m and how it brings together resources  [0m
[33m to go after those opportunities.  [0m
[33m Hey, never forget with your experience as a sales manager,  [0m
[33m you bring tremendous value to these marketing roles,  [0m
[33m but you also need to see this as an opportunity  [0m
[33m to get schooled on marketing concepts.  [0m
[33m So take advantage of it.  [0m
[33m Also be opportunistic when considering other roles  [0m
[33m outside of marketing.  [0m
[33m For example, you should consider a position overseas  [0m
[33m to build your global and cultural acumen,  [0m
[33m or perhaps you might want to take a temporary position  [0m
[33m on a special project team,  [0m
[33m perhaps related to a company merger.  [0m
[33m These all help develop your business experience.  [0m
[33m Always think of yourself as a lifelong learner.  [0m
[33m Stay on top of new technology,  [0m
[33m read about what other companies are doing.  [0m
[33m Look for best practices and other industries  [0m
[33m that might help you improve how you approach  [0m
[33m managing a sales team.  [0m
[33m If you consider yourself a sales professional,  [0m
[33m then I advise you to join the community of practice.  [0m
[33m Get out there and engage in organizations  [0m
[33m like the Sales Management Association,  [0m
[33m attend one of the many sales management conferences  [0m
[33m held each year and join sales related groups on LinkedIn.  [0m
[33m Attend networking events  [0m
[33m and get to know other sales management professionals.  [0m
[33m All learning is a process of taking an action,  [0m
[33m reflecting on what happened, learning from it,  [0m
[33m and then improving.  [0m
[33m You want to learn at a rate faster than the rate of change.  [0m
[33m That means you need to experiment,  [0m
[33m practice new sales management techniques  [0m
[33m while perfecting the old ones.  [0m
[33m And finally keep a strong ethical base  [0m
[33m when managing sales teams.  [0m
[33m So much is at stake when you consider the lives  [0m
[33m and careers of the sales professionals working for you.  [0m
[33m You have to constantly balance the needs of the business  [0m
[33m with the needs of the individual.  [0m
[33m Always communicate honestly, build trust  [0m
[33m and don't cut corners just to make sales numbers.  [0m
[33m Great sales managers earn respect  [0m
[33m from the people below them, above them,  [0m
[33m and from their peers based on their ethical approach  [0m
[33m to the job, not on how many awards they've won.  [0m
[33m Congratulations on completing the course.  [0m
[33m Now I want you to go out there  [0m
[33m and build and manage great sales teams.  [0m
[33m [0m

[34mAfter completing Mike Gamson's foundational leadership course, Lisa Earle McLeod's sales coaching course would likely be the most valuable next step for the audience. Here's why:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. Natural Progression:[0m
[34m- Gamson's course provides broad sales leadership fundamentals[0m
[34m- McLeod's course dives deeper into a specific, crucial aspect of sales leadership [0m[1;34m([0m[34mcoaching[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- It's a logical step from [0m[34m"how to run a team"[0m[34m to [0m[34m"how to coach a team to success"[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. Practical Application:[0m
[34m- Addresses a common pain point [0m[1;34m([0m[34m"without needing to hold their hand every minute"[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- Offers specific scenarios and situations [0m[1;34m([0m[34mpre-call preparation, call debriefs[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- Provides concrete differentiation between managing and coaching[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. Complementary Skills:[0m
[34m- While Gamson's course covers leadership voice and strategy[0m
[34m- McLeod's course focuses on day-to-day coaching interactions[0m
[34m- Helps translate high-level leadership principles into daily practice[0m

[34mWhile Steve Benson's course is also valuable, it appears to overlap more with Gamson's content [0m[1;34m([0m[34mteam building, hiring, training[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m rather than offering a new dimension to their learning. The coaching course would add [0m
