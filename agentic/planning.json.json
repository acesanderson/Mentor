The great reshuffle was born out of the COVID-19 pandemic  \\n and came about for a host of reasons.  \\n Much of it's centered around people redefining  \\n what they could and could not do  \\n to enjoy their work and life.  \\n Before March of 2020,  \\n teleworking was the exception to the rule,  \\n with only one in five workers doing so  \\n according to the Pew Research Center.  \\n Now that same institution says  \\n that number ballooned today to 71%.  \\n What's more, many are now working from a different home  \\n than they were at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \\n In a recent survey,  \\n the online real estate marketing site Zillow  \\n noted that 11% of people living in the United States  \\n moved in 2020.  \\n While they did so for personal reasons,  \\n many kept working for the same company throughout.  \\n In fact, many colleagues didn't even know  \\n that their coworkers shifted domiciles.  \\n Because of this, we should really think of the emerging  \\n work-from-home phenomenon to mean work-from-anywhere.  \\n This rapidly shifting trend provides incredible challenges,  \\n but also great opportunities that will forever stay  \\n within today's fluid business environment.  \\n As the work-from-home option remains ubiquitous  \\n for many organizations,  \\n the potential to recruit good talent from competitors  \\n who reside in any geographic area is now a reality.  \\n Companies in San Francisco or Silicon Valley, for example,  \\n can secure good people in say South Dakota  \\n or the Upper Peninsula of Michigan  \\n without the need to pay a relocation fee.  \\n For that matter, a firm in London can hire  \\n their next team member from Raleigh, North Carolina  \\n without disrupting that person's family life in the process.  \\n Timezones no longer limit you.  \\n On the flip side though,  \\n the telework trends means that competition  \\n for your top talent just got global.  \\n Your organization will need to supersize its efforts  \\n to keep employees engaged, satisfied, and productive.  \\n For many firms, recruiting and retaining human capital today  \\n is as fierce as the products and services they sell.  \\n A key determining factor to keeping employees informed,  \\n engaged, productive, and profitable  \\n is through an effective, periodic, disciplined  \\n multimodal employee communications program.  \\n In short, your work in this effort  \\n is now much more important in today's post COVID workplace.  \\n If there was ever a time to be in HR, and more specifically,  \\n responsible for the HR communications, it's now.  \\n You're even more of a strategic value than in years past  \\n and that will likely continue.  \\n In practical terms,  \\n your communication products will look different than before  \\n from both a messaging and call to action perspective.  \\n You're going to find yourself  \\n explaining policies and procedures less  \\n and telling stories of members in action more.  \\n You'll emphasize the human factors of your organization  \\n and connect with employees and prospective team members  \\n emotionally to reinforce a corporate culture  \\n that now extends well beyond the physical corporate campus.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3018877\",\"duration\":204,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"HR communications is now a much more strategic asset\",\"fileName\":\"3013243_en_US_01_02_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn why this program is no longer something that only concerns the HR team, but the entire company\u2014including the C-suite.

those who are fully employed\\nand fully engaged, and even if they're not looking\\nto change jobs.\\n\\nNext, slow down, focus on attracting people,\\nnot weeding them out.\\nAdd a delay switch to your Apply Now button.\\nFilling positions with the best people who apply\\nas rapidly as possible is an outdated\\nand ill-advised hiring strategy.\\nFor example, I just talked to a woman the other day,\\nshe couldn't hire enough security guards\\nbecause their salary was lower than their competition.\\nHowever, their training programs\\nand benefits were far superior.\\nI suggested she stop

she send an email\\ndescribing some new opportunities\\ndeveloping over the next three to six months\\nand ask people if they'd be open to engage\\nin an exploratory career conversation.\\nShifting to this consultative low-key approach\\nabout potential career opportunities\\nincreased her email response rate\\nby over 50% within one week.\\n\\nAnother aspect of this is improving the organization\\nand quality of the entire assessment process.\\nCandidates will judge your entire company\\nby the quality of the interviewing process,\\neven how well it's organized.\\nWell organized in-depth interviews\\nnot only increase assessment accuracy,\\nbut even people who don't get hired will feel respected.\\nFinally, make sure hiring managers can brand the job.\\nManagers who can clarify real job needs during the interview\\nhave a huge advantage when candidates compare opportunities.\\n\\nTying these tasks and challenges\\nto critical company projects or to an important\\ncompany mission reinforces the career opportunity\\ninherent in this job.\\nThe best candidates want to work for the best managers\\ndoing important and satisfying work.\\nImplementing a

those you don't like,\\nyou have to become more open minded,\\nso start off with the assumption they're competent\\nand then seek evidence to prove it.\\nAnother way to overcome your bias\\nis to treat the person as a subject matter expert.\\n\\nWe tend to treat those who are recognized SMEs,\\nsubject matter experts, like consultants\\nwith a lot of respect.\\nAnd when we hire consultants for a critical one-time project\\nwe're less concerned about first impressions\\nand we're more concerned with a person's ability\\nto handle the work.\\nThis, then, becomes the focus of the interview.\\nNow some people think first impressions are important\\nfor job success,\\nand whether that's true or not,\\nwhat is important is not to be affected by it.\\nTo get around this, wait until the end of the interview\\nto measure the person's true first impression.\\n\\nAs the person leaves, ask yourself this question.\\nHow would this person's first impression\\nimpact their on-the-job performance?\\nIf it's negative, then don't hire the person.\\nIf there's a fit, then invite the person in.\\nAnd when you meet,\\nyour focus will be on the person's performance,\\nnot their personality or presentation.\\nYou just have to wait 30 minutes\\nto better see the true person through more objective eyes.\\nIt will be 30 minutes well

efforts\\non outreach programs targeting passive candidates\\nand employee referrals.\\nHowever, you can't use the same weed out the weak\\nhiring process for referred and passive candidates\\nas you do for active candidates.\\n\\nInstead, you need to attract these people into your company.\\nThis can be done by thinking about the entire hiring process\\nbackwards.\\nHere's how.\\nFirst, break the

one.\\nThey get a job, they get a company,\\nthey get a title, and they get a salary.\\nDo is the actual work a person will be doing\\nin year one.\\nBecome represents the future

filtering candidates in or out\\nbased on what they get on day one.\\nThis is weeding out the weak process.\\nEven good candidates fall into the same trap.\\nThey want to know what they'll

needs\\nto do to be successful,\\nnot the skills a person needs to have.\\nThis is important, since highly referred candidates\\nare being referred because they can do the work.\\nDespite having a different mix of skills.\\n\\nFocusing on performance also broadens\\nthe talent pool to more diverse candidates\\nand high performers who get more done with less.\\nNow to get more top performers into the conversation,\\nrecruiters need to delay discussing\\nwhat they get on the first call.\\nFor example, when a candidate asks, \\\"What's the money?\\\"\\nI suggest that recruiters say something like,\\n\\\"If the job doesn't represent a career move,\\n\\\"it really doesn't matter what we pay you.\\n\\\"So let's first see if the job respresents\\n\\\"a career move, then we'll see if the compensation\\n\\\"can be worked out.\\\"\\nSeeing and hiring the best people\\nstarts by attracting the best people,\\nemphasizing what they'll do and could become.\\n\\nThat's how you raise the

those\\nthat can actually do the work required,\\nbut have a different mix of skills.\\nEvery person who has been promoted meets this criteria,\\nand there are a lot of top performers\\nin this group that most companies ignore.\\nBased on our own survey work, this group is at least\\n20 to 30 times bigger compared to the one person\\nwho's qualified who did apply.\\nTo capture people in this talent market\\nrequires a job posting, and outbound emails\\ndescribe the performance objectives of the job,\\nnot the skills required to do the job.\\n\\nThe idea here is that if a person has done comparable work,\\nhe or she has all of the required skills\\nand experiences, but in a different mix.\\nIn addition, jobs written this way are more appealing.\\nThis step alone will increase the response rate,\\nbut there is another talent market\\nthat's 50 to 100 times bigger in comparison\\nto that one qualified person who did apply.\\nThese are passive candidates who\\nare also performance qualified.\\nTo attract these people, not only do you need\\nto market the performance challenges of the job,\\nbut also emphasize the EVP, the employee value proposition.\\n\\nThe EVP describes why a top person\\nwould consider the job a true career move.\\nThat's how you maximize the response rate.\\nThere is a huge, untapped, talent market\\nrepresented by this diagram.\\nHowever, to tap into it, you need to shift\\nto a performance qualified assessment process,\\neliminate skills laden job descriptions\\nfor advertising purposes, and implement\\na consultative recruiting process,\\nrather than a transactional one.\\nBy converting lateral transfers into career opportunities,\\nyou'll not only raise the talent bar,\\nbut you'll also start hiring people,\\nwho are more motivated, more satisfied, and more engaged.\\n\\nThis is a strategic opportunity\\nof enormous potential that most companies ignore.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:479657\",\"duration\":244,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Eliminating barriers to

you've identified on LinkedIn\\nor posting a job, you need to understand\\nsome basic rules of consumer marketing\\nand advertising.\\n\\nHere are the big ones.\\nFirst, start with an

A-G-M needs to lead every recruiting message you write.\\n\\nWithout one, you'll only get mediocre results.\\nAnother tip is to highlight the intrinsic motivator\\nnear the beginning of your

of skills infested job descriptions.\\nThese only appeal to those with an economic need\\nto apply and who are also willing to jump through\\npsychological and physical hurdles\\nto land a lateral

them out.\\nAdd a delay switch to your apply now button.\\nFilling positions with the best people who apply\\nas rapidly as possible is an outdated and ill advised\\nhiring strategy.\\n\\nFor example, I just talked to a woman the other day.\\nShe couldn't hire enough security guards\\nbecause their salary was lower than their competition.\\nHowever, their training programs and benefits\\nwere far superior.\\nI suggested she stop filtering people out on compensation\\nand then suggest they watch a short video instead,\\ndescribing the complete opportunity.\\nBased on this, people could then apply.\\nWithin days, she had positive results.\\nStart to shift by changing from what you want\\nin terms of an ideal candidate,\\nto what an ideal candidate gets in terms of a better job.\\n\\nA key aspect of this is implementing a consultative\\nrecruiting process.\\nA friend of mine was having trouble getting\\nsenior engineering people to respond to her emails.\\nI suggested she send an email describing some\\nnew opportunities developing over the next\\nthree to six months, and ask people if they'd be open\\nto engage in an exploratory career conversation.\\nShifting to this consultative, low key approach\\nabout potential career opportunities increased\\nher email response rate by over 50 percent\\nwithin one week.\\n\\nAnother aspect of this is improving the organization\\nand quality of the entire assessment process.\\nCandidates will judge your entire company\\nby the quality of the interviewing process.\\nEven how well it's organized.\\nIf interviewers aren't prepared, ask narrow or ill advised\\ngotcha questions, sell the job too soon,\\nor appear disengaged, your opt out rate will increase\\nand your glass door rankings will plummet.\\nWell organized, in depth interviews not only increase\\nassessment accuracy, but even people who don't get hired\\nwill feel respected.\\n\\nFinally, make sure hiring managers can brand the job.\\nThe best candidates want to work for the best managers\\ndoing important and satisfying work.\\nManagers who can clarify real job needs\\nduring the interview have a huge advantage\\nwhen candidates compare opportunities.\\nTying these tasks and challenges to\\ncritical company projects or to an important\\ncompany mission reinforces the career opportunity\\ninherent in this job.\\nThis is called job branding.\\nAnd from what I've seen,\\nit's far more important than employer branding.\\n\\nImplementing a remarkable CX is not a trivial matter.\\nDone well, it represents the difference between hiring\\ngreat people on a consistent company wide basis,\\nor working too hard, one hire and one job at a time.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

also,\\nmuch less obvious, demonstrating to the candidate that\\nhiring top talent is important to your company's success.\\nThe performance-based interview weaves all of these\\nfactors together into a seamless, easy to learn process.\\nIt's comprised of these five basic sections.\\nNumber one is the preliminary round.\\n\\nIt's where you're gonna go with the introduction\\nand control your emotions.\\nThe second round we're gonna go through\\nthe work history review.\\nThe third round we're gonna dig deep into the candidate's\\naccomplishments using the most significant\\naccomplishment question.\\nThe fourth round we're gonna ask the candidate\\nto solve a realistic job-related question.\\nAnd the final round is we're gonna close\\nand recruit the candidate.\\nSo let's kinda go through each of these rounds\\na little bit depth.\\nThe introduction and emotional control round\\nis the preliminary round.\\nThis round is designed to put the candidate at ease,\\nincrease the interviewer's objectivity,\\nand find out the candidate's job hunting status.\\n\\nRather than starting the interview right away, it's best\\nto spend the first few minutes in a casual conversation.\\nStart by asking the person how they found out about the job,\\nif the person is actively looking for another job,\\nand what he or she knows about the job so far.\\nAbove all else, stay open minded.\\nDo not even think if the person is a possible candidate\\nor not based on the person's first impression.\\nIn fact, if you like the person, be a little bit\\nmore cynical, and if you don't like the person,\\ngive him or her the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\nWe tend to ask people we like easier questions\\nand people we don't like harder questions.\\nThis simple, mental trick will ensure you review\\neveryone's background objectively.\\nNow you're ready to conduct the work history review.\\nThis is the second round.\\nThe work history review is a major part of the assessment.\\nDon't take it lightly, spend at least 15 minutes on it\\nduring the phone screen and a minimum of\\n30 minutes on it during the full on-site interview.\\nBegin by going through all of the candidate's\\nmajor jobs for the past 3-10 years, or longer if necessary.\\n\\nAsk about the person's major accomplishments in each job,\\nwhat skill they used, and how they learned those skills.\\nHave them describe the teams they've been on,\\nif the person got promoted, or if the job got bigger.\\nAsk about formal recognition including awards,\\nspecial bonuses, or being assigned to critical projects.\\nThen find out why.\\nCritically focus on why the person changed jobs\\nand if the reason for changing was achieved.\\nThe best people change jobs for long-term career reasons\\nwhile most people change them for tactical,\\neconomic, or short-term convenience.\\n\\nNow you're ready to go to the third round,\\nthe most significant accomplishment question.\\nThe essence of the performance-based hiring process\\nis to ask the candidate to describe an accomplishment\\nfor each performance objective listed in the\\nperformance-based job description.\\nThis is how you assess comparable results.\\nIn a typical one hour interview, it's only possible\\nto dig into one or two or three of these accomplishments\\nsince it takes about 10-15 minutes of fact finding\\nto understand each one.\\nWhile other interviewers will be using the same\\nperformance-based hiring interview format,\\nthey'll be focusing on different accomplishments\\nand different factors.\\n\\nNow, the fourth round, we're getting into problem solving.\\nBy asking how a person would handle a realistic\\njob-related problem, you'll uncover thinking,\\nstrategic, and analytical skills.\\nDon't focus on the answer.\\nWhat you're really interested on how the person\\nwould solve the problem, so let the candidate ask questions\\nand then get into a give and take dialogue.\\nRecognize that just because someone knows how\\nto solve a problem, it could be more talk than substance.\\nTo confirm this, ask the person to describe some\\nactual accomplishment that best demonstrates their ability\\nto actually implement a solution.\\n\\nNow we're ready to recruit and close,\\nthis is the fifth and final round.\\nIn most situations, you can just end the interview\\nby asking if the candidate has any questions.\\nObserve the quality of these, though.\\nThe strongest candidates and the most interested\\nwill ask substantive questions about the job,\\nthe culture, the resources, and the people.\\nFor people you're interested in, recruiters and\\nhiring managers should also find out\\nthe candidate's interest level and how this job\\ncompares to others they're considering.\\nThis provides useful information to craft a career move\\nif the candidate could become a finalist.\\n\\nHowever, if you really like the candidate,\\ndo not oversell the job.\\nLet me repeat that loudly and strongly,\\ndo not oversell the job.\\nInstead, say you're interested in the person,\\nbut you have some other strong people you're\\nalso interviewing, then

More hiring mistakes\\nare made in the first 30 minutes of an interview\\nthan at any other time.\\nIf you can avoid making any yes or no decision,\\neven a hint of one, for at least 30 minutes\\nthe decision you ultimately make\\nwill likely be the right one.\\nThe problem is that when you like someone right away\\nyou start asking questions designed to prove\\nyour initial, intuitive, emotional assessment\\nis the correct one.\\nAnd if you don't like the person you do the exact opposite,\\nasking questions to prove the person is not competent.\\nSurprisingly, you'll be able to find the proof either way.\\n\\nThe first impression bias is usually triggered\\nby the person's appearance,\\nwhether they're confident or nervous,\\nfriendly or not, and even the quality of their handshake.\\nFor some people to determine\\nby whether the person is on time or not\\nand how well the person is prepared.\\nNone of these traits, good or bad\\npredict on the job success.\\nSometimes people are temporarily nervous.\\nWe've all met people who are great interviewers,\\nwho are poor performers.\\nAnd we've all met or worked with people\\nwho don't fit our instant idea of the perfect personality\\nwho wind up being top performers.\\n\\nThat's why I urge everyone\\nto give every candidate you meet, in person,\\nat least 30 minutes of your time.\\nAfter 30 minutes you'll discover the person\\nwhom you initially liked is more about presentation\\nrather than performance.\\nOr if the person you didn't think was too strong\\nis actually someone quite remarkable.\\nWait 30 minutes, this should be the foundational rule\\nfor every interviewing assignment you have.\\nIn my experience it will prevent at least 50%\\nof all the hiring mistakes you're ever likely to make.\\n\\nOf course waiting 30 minutes is easy to say\\nbut it's actually quite hard to do.\\nWith this in mind, here are some tips\\nthat can actually help you fight the tendency\\nto make a yes or no decision too soon.\\nFirst off, never meet the candidate in person first, never.\\nAlways conduct a 20 to 30 minute phone screen ahead of time.\\nAnd during this phone screen\\ngo through the candidate's work history view\\nand ask the candidate to describe a major accomplishment,\\nrelated to a significant aspect of your job.\\nIf there's a fit, then invite the person in.\\n\\nAnd when you meet\\nyour focus will be on the person's performance,\\nnot their personality or presentation.\\nSecond, you must listen to the judge.\\nDon't make a decision until you here all of the evidence.\\nYou have to fight the urge to judge people\\non faulty evidence, or filtered, or biased information.\\nAnd make sure you stay aware of any shift in your bias.\\nIf you sense yourself sliding into the position too soon\\nyou must stop.\\nFor those you like you have to be a bit more cynical,\\nforce yourself to prove they're competent.\\nAnd for those you don't like\\nyou have to become more open-minded\\nso start off with the assumption they're competent\\nand then seek evidence to prove it, not disprove it.\\n\\nAnother way to overcome your bias\\nis to treat the person as a subject matter expert.\\nWe tend to treat those who are recognized SMEs,\\nsubject matter experts, like consultants,\\nwith a lot of respect.\\nAnd when we hire consultants for a critical one time project\\nwe're less concerned about first impressions\\nand we're more concerned with the person's ability\\nto handle the work.\\nThis then becomes the focus of the interview.\\nSo just by treating candidates as consultants\\nyou'll automatically minimize the impact\\nof first impression.\\n\\nNow here's a big idea,\\nmeasure first impression at the end of the interview.\\nNow some people think first impressions\\nare important for job success\\nand whether that's true or not,\\nwhat is important is not to be affected by it.\\nTo get around this wait until the end of the interview\\nto measure the person's true first impression.\\nAs the person leaves ask yourself this question,\\n\\\"How would this person's first impression\\n\\\"impact their on-the-job performance?\\\"\\nIf it's negative than don't hire the person.\\nHowever, what you'll more likely discover\\nis that many of the people you thought\\nhad a weak first impression are actually remarkable people.\\n\\nAnd just as important,\\nmany of the people with good first impressions\\nturn out to be more show than substance.\\nYou just have to wait 30 minutes\\nto better see the true person, through more objective eyes,\\nit will be 30 minutes well spent.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:479666\",\"duration\":217,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Conducting

long did it take to complete?\\nWhat were the big challenges you faced\\nand what were the big changes you implemented?\\nDescribe the team and your role on the team.\\n\\nHow did you impact or

[Voiceover] The core of the performance-based interview\\nconsists of a thorough work history review,\\nspending lots of time digging into the candidate's\\nmajor accomplishments, and then dialoguing\\nabout the most important and realistic job-related problems.\\nThat's it, but when I suggest this,\\nI'm often asked this question.\\nDoes everyone ask the same questions?\\nWell, the answer is yes and no.\\nWhile the same basic interview is used,\\nit's modified depending on the stage in the process\\nand who's conducting the interview.\\nThe overriding goal of the interview is to obtain\\nenough information for each of the factors\\nin the performance-based hiring job fit index.\\n\\nThis requires some organization and role assignment\\nto do it properly.\\nHere's how this works.\\nThe recruiter typically determines basic fit\\nduring the phone screen.\\nThe hiring manager needs to cover everything\\nacross multiple interviews.\\nThe other interviewers on the hiring team\\nshould be assigned one or two factors to focus on and own.\\nThis way everyone can provide valuable information\\nduring the debriefing session.\\nGiven this objective, here's how to organize\\nthe entire interviewing process\\nin each phase of the interview.\\n\\nFor the phone screen, spend the first 15 to 20 minutes\\non the work history review, getting a quick overview\\nof the person's major accomplishments at each job,\\nlooking for promotions or recognition\\nfor doing excellent work.\\nThen find out why the person changed jobs\\nand how they got each job\\nand if the purpose for changing jobs was achieved.\\nYou're looking for a career focus with these job changes\\nsince this is a common trait of the strongest candidates.\\nIf the person seems to be a good fit,\\nask the person to describe a major accomplishment\\nmost related to the job.\\n\\nThis should be enough to determine basic fit with the job\\nand if the interviewing process should be continued.\\nRecruiters always need to conduct a phone screen,\\nbut I urge hiring managers to conduct\\na very similar interview on the phone\\nbefore meeting the candidate in person.\\nThis will minimize the impact of first impressions\\nand increase objectivity when the candidate\\ndoes come on site.\\nLet's get into the one-hour on-site interview.\\nHiring managers should conduct\\nthe full performance-based interview\\nwhen first meeting the candidate on-site.\\n\\nThis is a combination of the work history review,\\ndigging into one major team accomplishment\\nand one major individual accomplishment\\nand then discussing one major job-related problem in depth.\\nMake sure you keep good notes.\\nAs a minimum, describe the accomplishment\\nwith specific figures, facts, details, and dates.\\nYou'll use this to rank the candidate\\nat the debriefing session.\\nNow, here's how to organize the whole interview.\\nIt's essential to have at least three or four people\\ninvolved in the interviewing process, but more than five,\\nthat's going to be kind of counterproductive.\\n\\nBut let me strongly state,\\nand I want to state this three or four times.\\nA series of 30-minute one-on-one interviews\\nis a waste of time.\\nA waste of time.\\nI'd ban these if I could, and you should too.\\nA much better approach is to conduct\\na 90-minute well-organized panel interview\\nwith three or four team members.\\nAlternatively, a series of 45-minute individual interviews\\nis also okay or some combination.\\nFor the panel interview, there needs to be one leader\\nwith everyone else fact-finders.\\n\\nThe leader asks about major accomplishments,\\nand the fact-finders follow up\\nwith asking clarifying questions.\\nForget the idea of having everyone\\nask their favorite question.\\nThis is also a big waste of time.\\nRegardless of the approach,\\ninterviewers involved in these subsequent interviews\\nshould narrow their focus to only one or two of the factors\\nin the performance-based hiring job fit index.\\nFor example, if the focus is on technical competency,\\ndescribe a major technical performance objective.\\nThen have the candidate describe\\na major comparable accomplishment.\\n\\nBy narrowing the focus this way,\\nthere will be a lot of rich evidence to share\\nduring the debriefing session.\\nCollectively you want to use the divide and conquer approach\\nto organize the interview.\\nLack of organization often dooms the interviewing process\\nprimarily since much of the needed information\\nis never obtained.\\nThis problem is easy to prevent by using\\nthe same basic performance-based hiring interview structure\\nbut clarifying the roles of each interviewer\\naround the job fit index factors.\\nIt doesn't take much time\\nto organize the interview properly,\\nbut it's a waste of everyone's time if it's not done.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"5.

work\\nbut has a different mix of skills and experiences.\\nIt makes no sense to exclude this group\\nof outstanding people from consideration.\\nA performance based interview is all you need\\nto

 \\n One way we can make sure incentive dollars  \\n are being used wisely  \\n is by using the cost, ease, and impact formula.  \\n This approach allows you to test your way to the best way.  \\n I'll give you an example of how it works.  \\n One of my clients was a construction company  \\n looking to improve employee engagement and reduce turnover,  \\n so they went along with the idea of having a fund committee.  \\n Now, the committee was funded with $10 per employee per week  \\n and they put three volunteers in charge of the project.  \\n Their simple instruction was use the cost, ease,  \\n and impact formula to prioritize the use of those dollars.  \\n Now, the committee knew what their cost was, $10 per week,  \\n so they looked at two ways of spending it  \\n by bringing in lunch every Friday  \\n or doing car washes every other Friday.  \\n The committee realized the cost was the same  \\n and the ease of implementation was the same  \\n since it was all outsourced,  \\n so they decided to let the employees choose  \\n to show which option will provide the greatest impact.  \\n The employees overwhelmingly said  \\n they would rather have their cars washed  \\n and so the decision was an easy one to make.  \\n The most cost effective incentive of all  \\n is a written thank you note from the boss.  \\n It costs less than a few dollars,  \\n take less than 10 minutes to write,  \\n and can provide engagement dividends that last.  \\n Thank that employee about something specific  \\n and then send it to their home.  \\n When you're putting together incentive programs,  \\n do like great marketers do and test, test, test  \\n until you get that cost, ease, and impacts formula  \\n down to a science, then roll it out big time.  \\n I put an Excel spreadsheet in the exercise file.  \\n It's called Engagement Program Possibilities  \\n and will give you an idea of how the formula works  \\n with several different types of incentive programs.  \\n We all go to work to get paid.  \\n How you use compensation strategies and incentives  \\n will go a long way to driving engagement.  \\n It starts with paying new employees well  \\n and testing different incentives  \\n to produce engagement, retention,  \\n and a more profitable bottom line.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3152843\",\"duration\":168,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Provide opportunities for career growth\",\"fileName\":\"570964_02_06_MM30_growth_2021Q2\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Most of your best and engaged employees want to grow in their careers.

Philosophy  \\n was built to help other companies.  \\n The mantra for that program is, be there, play,  \\n make their day and choose your attitude.  \\n Here's the point.  \\n If the folks at Pike's Place can decide to have fun,  \\n working with dead, slimy and smelly fish every day,  \\n you can decide to have fun where you work.  \\n It's simply a choice.  \\n Southwest Airlines is another excellent example  \\n of a company that decided to have fun.  \\n They decided to make flying a fun experience  \\n for both employees and customers.  \\n The result has been one of the most successful  \\n public companies in history.  \\n I'm amazed when I walk around airports  \\n and see the level of engagement with Southwest employees  \\n and customers and then I see everyone else.  \\n Southwest's culture of fun has made them  \\n one of the top rated airlines to work for and to fly.  \\n So why don't other airlines and travel related businesses  \\n adopt the same approach?  \\n For no good reason I can think of.  \\n Same thing at Pike's Place Market.  \\n I looked around to see who else picked up  \\n on the Fish! Philosophy culture.  \\n Next door is a fruit and vegetable stand that's got it.  \\n The apples and bananas are flying,  \\n there's high energy and great sales,  \\n while less than a hundred feet away  \\n is another fish vendor with two guys behind the counter  \\n and no customers in sight.  \\n It's obvious that the Fish! Philosophy approach  \\n generates long lines every day,  \\n yet that business owner chose not to adopt it.  \\n And I can't imagine why.  \\n Download the 10 Ideas to Increase Engagement form  \\n from the Exercise Files and use it to come up with ways  \\n to make your company more fun.  \\n Here are four quick ideas I put on that form  \\n to help get you started.  \\n Have a fun committee and give it five or $10 per employee,  \\n per week to generate some fun.  \\n Run some fun and crazy contests, funniest customer story,  \\n a haiku contest, best company poster, you name it.  \\n Celebrate birthdays, work anniversaries  \\n and corporate milestones with a band in.  \\n And remember to celebrate Red Nose Day on May 25th.  \\n Life is too short not to have fun.  \\n Step up and take the lead where you work.  \\n Help develop a culture of fun  \\n and you'll develop a culture of engagement at the same time.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"4.

you become a user of data to drive change, I want to make\\nthis point very clear.\\nThe key to effectively solving any problem is first determining the root cause\\nbefore implementing a solution.\\nMany initiatives fail when this fundamental principle is violated.\\nIn this lesson, we'll cover some important techniques to help you figure out the\\nproblem before implementing a solution.\\nThe first one, don't miss the forest for the trees.\\nIn problem-solving, it's essential to see the big picture and avoid getting bogged\\ndown by minor details that may distract from the true issue.\\n\\nStep back and consider the overall context.\\nWhat logically could be driving the problem?\\nLook for connections between different factors and think holistically to\\nunderstand how various elements interact.\\nThis broader perspective helps you avoid missing the forest for the trees\\nand ensures you target the root cause, rather than just addressing symptoms.\\nAs part of this process, you need to think like a data analyst.\\nTo get started, always ask yourself two critical questions.\\nOne, what information do I need to collect to figure out the problem?\\nAnd two, what data do I need to determine the best solution?\\nFor example, if faced with high employee turnover, gather information on employee\\nsatisfaction, exit interviews, and performance metrics.\\n\\nBy collecting and analyzing this data, you can spot patterns and develop\\ninsights that reveal the true issue.\\nAs part of this, be sure to peel the onion using the \\\"Five Whys\\\" technique.\\nThis technique involves repeatedly asking why to uncover the root of an issue.\\nFor instance, if employee engagement is low, ask why is employee engagement low?\\nIf the answer is because employees feel undervalued, ask why do\\nthey feel undervalued?\\nContinue this process until the fundamental cause is revealed.\\nThis method prevents you from treating symptoms instead of the real problem.\\n\\nIt's also important to reach out to others as part of your evaluation.\\nI call this the \\\"Five Whos\\\" approach.\\nThis involves proactively reaching out to five other people who may\\nhave valuable insights.\\nAsk who knows the answer.\\nSeek perspectives from other departments to get a broader\\nnon-HR understanding of the problem.\\nFor example, when addressing a productivity issue,\\nask a colleague in operations for some insight.\\nIt might reveal that technical or facilities-related problems are affecting\\nemployee output, something you would never have considered.\\n\\nThis collaborative approach demonstrates both your curiosity and leadership.\\nBe sure to walk the floor.\\nTo fully understand a problem, get out of your office and into the workplace.\\nObserving employees in their work environment allows you to gather\\nfirst-hand insights that data alone may not reveal.\\nWalking the floor and talking to people helps you better understand workflows,\\nchallenges, and workforce dynamics.\\nThese observations are invaluable in developing an accurate understanding\\nof what's really happening.\\n\\nNow you need to think like Sherlock Holmes.\\nChannel your inner detective by using deductive reasoning\\nto piece together evidence.\\nAnalyze data, search for patterns, and identify anomalies.\\nFor example, if you're investigating rising absenteeism,\\ncompare attendance records with workload data to find correlations.\\nThis approach helps you form accurate conclusions and develop\\ntargeted solutions.\\nActively gathering and examining data using these techniques allows you\\nto see both the forest and the trees.\\n\\nIt starts by adopting an analytical mindset and digging deep,\\nleaving no stone unturned.\\nThis allows you to expose underlying causes rather than reacting\\nto surface symptoms.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4297895\",\"duration\":223,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using the sample

employee satisfaction is related\\nto their work-from-home percentage.\\nThe chi-square test helps you determine if the differences observed are\\nsignificant or just random.\\n\\nNext, we explored the t-test, which is helpful when comparing one\\nnumerical variable against another.\\nFor instance, you're comparing the satisfaction levels\\nbetween employees promoted internally versus externally.\\nThe t-test can reveal if the differences are meaningful or just caused by chance.\\nFinally, we covered ANOVA, Analysis of Variance.\\nThis test is used when you want to compare a numerical variable across\\nmore than two groups.\\nFor example, you could compare employee satisfaction among different tenure groups\\nlike less than one year, one to five years, and over five years.\\n\\nANOVA shows that the differences in satisfaction are significant\\nor merely coincidental.\\nThese tests: chi-square, t-test, and ANOVA allow you to analyze data\\nand make informed decisions on various HR factors like satisfaction,\\nperformance, and productivity.\\nThe key is to use inferential statistics whenever you need to draw conclusions\\nor make predictions about a larger population based on a sample.\\nThis could be determining if certain hiring managers build high-performing\\nteams, or assessing whether a training program has significantly\\nimproved employee performance.\\n\\nNow, let me introduce you to the Cox Regression Model, or CRM.\\nThis is another inferential statistical tool that is used to predict\\nthe likelihood of an event occurring over time, such as employee turnover.\\nFor example, you might use it to understand how job\\nsatisfaction, work location, or years with the company impact\\nthe risk of employees leaving.\\nThis will help in determining which groups are more likely to leave and what\\norganizational factors could reduce turnover.\\nCRM is a very advanced statistical tool that could be combined with AI and machine\\nlearning that you should at least be familiar with.\\n\\nWhile as an HR staff person or business partner, you will likely not perform\\nthe analysis yourself, knowing about the model can be invaluable\\nfor directing resources or figuring out how to solve a problem or prevent one.\\nFor example, in an upcoming case study, we'll discuss how one company used CRM\\nto pinpoint which employees were at the highest risk of leaving\\nand intervene to reduce turnover.\\nThis is an exciting example of how data analysis can impact real-world results.\\n\\nRemember, the goal of this

after, but they all involve data\\ncollection as a starting point.\\n\\nThis typically involves gathering both quantitative and qualitative information\\nthrough surveys, interviews, and secondary research.\\nBut don't do it alone.\\nPartner with your data analytics team to figure out what's needed.\\nAnd one of the case studies we'll discuss in a later lesson, you meet Lydia Wu,\\na brilliant talent analytics leader.\\nWhile we were preparing the case study for this course,\\nLydia told me about a benchmarking study she led, comparing the performance of data\\nentry clerks who were maintaining the company's HRIS system.\\n\\nThe results were eye-opening.\\nThe top-performing team processed around 300 tickets daily, while the bottom\\nteam managed only 50 tickets.\\nThat's a 500 percent difference in productivity.\\nWhile impressive, understanding the results requires\\nyou to be a bit skeptical.\\nIt's crucial to dig deeper.\\nMaybe the comparison is to the top one percent to the bottom one percent.\\nOr maybe these differences are due to training or different\\ntechnology being used.\\nBeing skeptical is the key when looking at benchmarking reports.\\n\\nRegardless of how impressive the source, always validate any benchmarking\\nresults to your unique circumstances.\\nYou'll lose all credibility if you don't.\\nBenchmarking is a great way to justify any major change initiative,\\nbut it's important to recognize that the data itself is not what's important.\\nWhat is important is understanding what the data says and using the insights\\nto tell compelling

So a control A was really around high-risk employees.\\nSo our model was saying, based on these parameters,\\nthese people are most likely to leave in the next six months.\\nWe identified about 120 of those.\\n\\nOn the other side with control B, we wanted to identify people who had\\nsimilar level of performance and the same function, similar roles.\\nSo they were like like to like.\\nNow with the 120, we did a lot of interventions like made lateral moves\\nand better onboarding, so many things that we did with them.\\nWith the control B panel, we did not actually do any intervention.\\nAnd then we just watched the results of those interventions.\\nAnd we found it was zero percent attrition in control A,\\nwhere we had done the interventions versus 35 percent attrition among control B,\\nwhere we had not done any intervention.\\n\\nThis kind of showed that the actions we took were leading to outcomes.\\nNow let's kind of zoom out.\\nWhat kind of general advice would you give to an HR person who is interested\\nin structuring an A/B test and a control group test?\\nYes, always make them matched.\\nImagine if you had 100 people and you divided them in a random way, but they\\nwere always matched on certain parameters.\\nWhat happens is imagine if one group has more high performers versus another group\\nin the other control group, and it has low performers,\\nthen automatically you're comparing apples with oranges.\\n\\nSo all you have to do is to make sure that the two panels are well-matched.\\nSo it seems like providing employee lateral transfers has\\na huge impact on retention.\\nI think you'd agree with that.\\nWhat were the other key or big findings from that specific project you found?\\nYes, I mean, another one, Lou, was the boomerangs,\\npeople who left the company when they come back to the company,\\nthey actually stay for much more longer than others, and they perform better\\nbecause now they've been exposed to the outside world.\\n\\nSo we actually made recruiting go to some of the company's alums\\nand start recruiting from there.\\nSo suddenly, attrition was your best friend, because all the people who had\\nleft the company became your recruiting ground.\\nThat's great insight.\\nThank you very much, Piyush.\\nI appreciate sharing your evidence and your experience\\nwith everyone on this call.\\nThank you very, very much.\\nThanks, Lou, for having me.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"6.

It's nice to see you here.\\nLet me take a step back and ask you this general question.\\nFrom your perspective, what was the big challenge you faced\\non this project, and how did you get involved in it from the beginning?\\nYes, absolutely, Lou.\\nThanks so much for having me here.\\nAnd hi everyone.\\nSo I think during that entire journey, one of the biggest challenges we've had\\nwas really to build credibility as an HR team and gain the trust of our business.\\nAnd the way that we looked at it was, how do we earn the trust of the business\\nfrom a genuine angle so that as an HR team, we're not just looked\\nat from a recruiting perspective, but we're also a trusted partner\\nto the business in terms of driving their bottom line.\\n\\nAnd it was using that level of genuine curiosity towards the business.\\nThat's how we gained their trust to help us understand how the business processes\\nand battery manufacturing actually worked.\\nAnd in that sense, that then helped us understand what\\naspects of the people challenges were they truly experiencing\\nin their day-to-day lives.\\nAnd I think the second challenge that we've had along the way, too,\\nwas really to being able to tie people impact with business\\nmetrics and business impact.\\n\\nA lot of us know that from an HR standpoint, engagement is important,\\nretention is really important.\\nBut the ability to articulate how engagement and retention ultimately drives\\nthe business outcomes for us, the production numbers,\\nas well as the decreased scrap amount, that was absolutely critical\\nin understanding that.\\nAnd we really could not have done any of that without understanding\\nfrom the business and without them partnering with us as an HR team.\\nSo after we had a chance to walk the factory floor and get a better\\nunderstanding of what it took to prepare for battery manufacturing and to actually\\nwork on the floor for battery manufacturing,\\nthe appreciation for the level of physical effort, the level of tenacity that is\\nrequired to take the job increased significantly.\\n\\nAnd for us, it was truly that appreciation of being able to understand what\\nadditional character traits, soft skills we're looking\\nfor in the candidates, in addition to the hard skill\\nqualifications that we would need then.\\nNow, using that insight, how did you change your hiring practices\\nto adapt for that unusual situation or handle those issues?\\nAbsolutely.\\nSo historically, we hired similar to many manufacturing operations in terms of list\\nof certifications, amount of qualification criteria, and so on and so forth.\\n\\nAfter that, what we started looking for was really an attitude\\nof teamwork success.\\nBecause at the end of the day, when you are on shift for 12 hours around\\nthe clock, it becomes incredibly challenging to do that type of work\\nif you don't have people around you.\\nAnd the second thing that we look for is the ability to endure through hardship\\nand different situations, because again, we try to do everything we can to make\\neverything as comfortable as possible.\\nBut realistically speaking, manufacturing environments are incredibly\\nchallenging and does require a level of resilience and tenacity to be\\nable to work in those environments.\\n\\nSo in addition to just looking for people who are able to fill positions\\nand who could take the training to fill the roles, we also started to look\\nfor a lot more of the soft skills and the more character-based skill sets,\\nwhich then ultimately also helped us drive the retention numbers\\ntowards the end as well.\\nSo given the changes you made, can you give us some bottom-line KPIs or\\nmetrics that change as a result of the work you did?\\nYes, absolutely.\\nSo in terms of before and after comparing what we know of the production lines,\\nas well as the changes we made in our recruitment and retention process,\\nwe were able to take our annual turnover rate, which is roughly around 30 percent,\\na little bit over 30 percent when we first started, down to about 18 percent\\nin the time span of 18 months, and we were able to stabilize it\\nin that 18 to 20 percent range once we hit the 24-month mark.\\n\\nSo that's when we knew the actions that we took, and all of the lessons that we\\nlearned were able to translate into the business outcomes\\nthat everyone was looking for.\\nWell, to me, there's a lot of lessons in that specific situation on hiring,\\non workforce planning, and in process management.\\nAre there any bigger lessons you could apply for an HR generalist who is\\nlistening to our conversation?\\nSo I think one of the biggest lessons we've learned along the way,\\nand this is lesson for everyone in HR, is to know how to follow the money,\\nto then be able to tell the story and the impact of the HR organization.\\n\\nIt wasn't until that we started partnering with the operational side of our team\\nthat we truly saw how the people part of the equation translated\\ninto manufacturing success, which ultimately translated into financial\\noutcomes for the organization.\\nAnd in learning that, what we were able to do in that two-year\\njourney that we've taken together is consistently tie our HR initiatives\\ninto manufacturing outcomes, into the business outcomes which allowed\\nour business leaders to have a much better appreciation of why certain actions were\\nbeing taken in HR, and why certain initiatives were being\\ntaken in HR, in addition to the typical engagement or retention metrics\\nthat we would talk about.\\n\\nThe second lesson that we learned throughout this entire process is\\nthe notion of trust and verify.\\nA lot of times working in HR, I think we hear about stakeholder complaints.\\nFor example, as you've just mentioned, we heard a lot about our operation leaders\\nsaying, hey, we don't have enough head count.\\nWhat are we going to do about it?\\nBring us more head counts.\\nIt's human nature to say, no, you're wrong in those situations.\\nBut for us in learning trust and verify, we trusted our stakeholders gut instincts.\\nWe knew that it may be biased, but from their experience,\\nit had to have come from somewhere.\\n\\nAnd in trusting that instinct, what we were able to do was really follow\\nthe leads and get an understanding of their perspective.\\nThat led us to uncovering a lot of the data, a lot of the procedural\\nissues that were so minute that from the 5,000-foot-down level,\\nwe would not have noticed otherwise.\\nThank you very, very much, Lydia.\\nThose are remarkable lessons, and I thank you for sharing them with everyone here.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"7.

like it sounds, like a golf game scorecard\\nyou will lay out the key result areas and indicators,\\nand then measure your ability to reach them.\\nNow let's look at some vocabulary\\nrelated to metrics themselves.\\n\\nHR analytics is the process of correlating business data\\nand people data to show the impact HR has\\non an organization and drive business decisions.\\nIt's about using metrics to improve people performance,\\nso leaders can improve the organization's performance.\\nPredictive analytics is the practice\\nof extracting information from your data\\nin order to predict future outcomes.\\nIf you're doing predictive analytics,\\nyou're providing risk management\\nbecause you can see the future\\nwith some reliability and act accordingly.\\n\\nYou can determine what personality traits\\nbest suit a leader in your company,\\nor when people might leave, for example.\\nBig data refers to sets of data that can be analyzed\\nto reveal patterns, trends, and associations.\\nSimply, if you're measuring a bunch of different things\\nand loading them into one place where you can analyze\\nhow all that information interacts,\\nthen you'd be working with big data.\\nIn measuring and analyzing initiatives\\nyou'll need to come up with a research hypothesis\\nbefore crunching the numbers.\\n\\nA hypothesis is a statement that speculates the outcome.\\nFor example, you might hypothesize\\nthat attendance at a customer service training\\nwill increase customer satisfaction scores.\\nYou can then look at attendance in the training,\\nor interaction with

So where do you begin on your metrics endeavor?\\nHow about scoping out areas where you can show value?\\nDownload the Exercise File and fill it in as we go along.\\nThe point of this exercise is to understand\\nwhat your organization's strategic goals are\\nand how HR can help to achieve them\\nand, ultimately, how success can be measured.\\nSo let's talk through this worksheet.\\nYou hopefully have access\\nto your organization's strategic plan\\nor have some information\\nabout where your organization is headed.\\n\\nWrite those goals down on the worksheet.\\nFor the sake of an example,\\nlet's say one of your company's strategies is\\nto increases sales by 10% this year.\\nIn order to help the business achieve that goal,\\nHR will have to determine what competencies people need,\\nhow to develop those competencies in people,\\nhow to measure success in developing them,\\nand how they helped increase sales by 10%.\\nHR might be able to do that\\nby turning to their HR management system, or HRMS,\\nin order to obtain the data needed to achieve these results.\\n\\nIf you don't have an HRMS,\\nthen you may have to go the old fashioned route\\nand do a plain old job analysis,\\nor at the very least ask managers and employees\\nwho has what competencies.\\nYou've got to start somewhere.\\nNext, identify what information would be useful\\nto have for measurement, what processes need to be in place\\nto obtain that information,\\nand what key performance indicators, or KPIs,\\ncan be tied to the outcome.\\nUsing your example, it would be useful to know\\nif the sales training was well-received\\nthrough a simple survey, but you'll want to understand\\nif behaviors changed as a result of the training.\\n\\nThis behavior change is your KPI.\\nYou might see those KPIs by looking at quality scores,\\nlistening in to phone calls,\\nor reviewing the customer relationship management software,\\nor CRM, to see if new processes are being followed.\\nAlso look at whether the tools shared\\nin the training are resulting in higher contract amounts\\nor a higher number of closes, more KPIs.\\nThe idea is that you can take advantage of the information\\nat your fingertips to benchmark performance.\\n\\nFinally, you'll want to ensure you've thought through\\nhow HR can prove their involvement had positive results.\\nIf the 10% goal is achieved,\\nHR can certainly claim a big portion of that responsibility.\\nIn this case, you ensured people had the right competencies\\nand can prove your training changed behavior,\\nwhich got results.\\nSo what do you do now?\\nGet started.\\nStart where you are.\\nLook at what you're measuring now and go from there.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

Since people are a company's greatest asset,\\nrecruiting is an important job.\\nIn the old days, we sprayed and prayed,\\nposting our job openings wherever,\\nand hoping the right candidate faxed over their resume.\\nObviously, with the internet and technology,\\nrecruiting has gotten a lot more fun\\nand a lot more strategic.\\nThere are several metrics to use\\nin measuring your recruiting efforts,\\nso let's take a look.\\nTime to fill is an easy one.\\nSimply add up the total number of days\\nan open job goes unfilled.\\n\\nTo find the average time to fill,\\nyou will add up the number of days\\nall of your open positions were open\\nand divide that by the number of open positions.\\nSo, if between four open jobs\\nthey were open for a total of 76 days,\\nyou divide 76 by four\\nand your average time to fill is 19 days.\\nYou can also look at time to close\\nor the amount of days that lapse\\nfrom a candidate's first contact with you\\nto signing the offer.\\n\\nTime to fill can help you understand\\nefficiency of your recruiting process and strategy,\\nbut you'll want to look at this number\\nin conjunction with your source of higher metric,\\nbecause if time to fill is high,\\nit could be a result of where you're looking\\nor that your process is too long.\\nSo let's look at source of hire.\\nIf you have an applicant tracking software,\\nthen you're all set, as each candidate is tagged\\nwith source of entry.\\nIf you don't, you'll have to ask candidates\\nhow they learned about the job\\nand keep track of it manually.\\n\\nEither way, once you understand\\nwhere you're most successful,\\nyou can allocate resources to those areas\\nand ensure the best ROI.\\nYou can also try to understand\\nwhy some areas work better than others\\nand if it makes sense to change your strategies.\\nQuality of hire is also important to consider\\nwhen looking at source of hire.\\nYou might get 25 people from one job board\\nand 15 from LinkedIn.\\nBut if the quality is better on LinkedIn,\\nthen that may be where you want to focus your efforts.\\n\\nQuality of hire measures the value\\nnew hires bring to the company.\\nIt includes job performance and productivity\\nwithin a given time,\\nengagement, cultural fit,\\nand turnover of new hires.\\nOf course, some of this is subjective,\\nso let's look at ways to reduce that subjectivity.\\nConsider creating a 30, 60, and 90-day quality score.\\nChoose three to five key performance indicators\\nfor performance, ramp-up time,\\nengagement, and cultural fit.\\n\\nThen, managers can rate these new hires using your KPIs.\\nI put an example in the exercise file for you,\\nbut you have to really look at each position you're filling\\nand determine what KPIs mean for each.\\nFor performance, you might ask managers\\nto rate how well the new hire is performing X, Y, and Z.\\nFor ramp-up time, ask them to mark\\nhow long it took before those tasks\\nwere being performed well.\\nEngagement, on the other hand,\\nmight be measured by a short survey you give the new hire.\\n\\nCultural fit might be viewed\\nas whether the new hire is socializing\\nor integrating into the work team.\\nKeep it simple, only three to five\\nindicators for each category.\\nThen, input these numbers in your quality of hire formula.\\nJob performance plus ramp-up time\\nplus engagement plus cultural fit\\ndivided by the four factors.\\nSo using the scores your manager\\nmay have given this new hire,\\nyou might say average job performance\\non the three KPIs was four out of five, or 80%.\\n\\nAverage ramp-up time was also four out of five, or 80%.\\nBased on the five question engagement survey\\nyou provided the new hire, engagement is 95%.\\nAnd the manager measured cultural fit at 90%.\\nDivide that by four and the quality of hire score is 86%.\\nFrom there, you can determine how well you did\\noverall for the year.\\nAs an example, let's say you hired 20 people\\nand five of them did not stay on.\\n\\nAnd let's say you've decided\\nthat your target quality per hire score for individuals\\nor acceptable productivity is 80%.\\nNow let's look at the math.\\nThe average quality per hire score for all 20 is 85%.\\n13 out of the 15 who stayed\\nare at the acceptable productivity of 80%,\\nso that's 87%.\\nAnd since five left, your retention rate is 75%.\\nDivide that by three.\\n\\nYour average quality of hire is 82% for the year.\\nYou may be able to find an industry\\nquality of hire number to compare yourself to,\\nbut, at the very least,\\nyou can benchmark your own quality of hire score\\nyear over year or quarter over quarter.\\nCost per hire looks at all the expenses\\ninvolved in hiring a new employee\\nand demonstrates the value\\nof your systems and recruiting venues.\\nUnderstanding the cost per hire\\ncan help you eliminate costs\\nor inspire you to try new venues\\nthat might work better for your business.\\n\\nCost per hire is the total external costs\\nplus total internal costs\\ndivided by the number of hires.\\nYou'll have to spend some time brainstorming costs.\\nExternal costs include fees for posting ads\\nor using agencies, expenses for recruiting,\\nassessments, and background checks.\\nInternal costs might include any software you use,\\ndevelopment cost of the recruiting team,\\nor bonuses you pay to employees for referrals.\\n\\nOne last metric I suggest is candidate satisfaction.\\nUsing a short survey, you can determine\\nif your recruiting process is pleasant\\nand contributes to a positive employer brand.\\nIn the end, keep in mind that all of these steps are related\\nCost per hire can be affected by onboarding\\nand onboarding can be affected by quality of hire\\nand quality of hire can be affected by source of hire.\\nKeep track of the metrics I've outlined here,\\nas well as others that are of interest to you,\\nand then you can see how they all relate,\\nwhat's working and not, and, most importantly,\\nprove your value to your leadership team.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:692254\",\"duration\":318,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Measuring onboarding

quickly.\\nMeasuring onboarding is indeed important.\\nThe less effective your onboarding,\\nthe more likely someone is to leave.\\n\\nEffective onboarding programs achieve four things.\\nRole clarity: employees understand\\ntheir role and expectations.\\nSelf-efficacy: employees feel confident\\nin their ability to perform.\\nSocial integration: employees feel connected\\nto their new peers.\\nKnowledge of culture: employees understand\\npolicies and history of the company\\nbut also the values and unsaid social rules.\\nOur onboarding measurements need to be\\nfocused in these areas.\\n\\nLet's start with role clarity.\\nThe best metric here is time to proficiency,\\nor the length of time it takes for a new hire\\nto reach full productivity.\\nYou can measure this through quizzes that assess\\nknowledge and skills, observation,\\nor asking managers to score proficiency\\nof a variety of job tasks at various intervals.\\nYou could also ask managers to check off\\njob competencies they observe the new hire demonstrate,\\nand when they demonstrated them.\\n\\nLet's say the new hire has 15 job competencies\\nand the manager notices within the first week\\nthe new hire has two of them down pat.\\nThen at the end of week two the new hire\\nseems to have mastered one more, and so forth.\\nBy keeping track of when what was mastered,\\nthe manager can see time to proficiency\\nand where problems are along the way.\\nNow you can adjust training as needed.\\nYou can also average the information out\\nfor all of your new hires\\nto see where there are gaps in your onboarding processes.\\n\\nYou can also measure new hires against\\nkey performance indicators or KPIs.\\nLet's say you hire a new HR assistant\\nand one task is developing training workbooks.\\nYou can develop at least one KPI for this task\\nand measure her against it at 30, 60, and 90 days.\\nA KPI might be that they require minimal revision from you.\\nAt 30 days you might have to revise 50% of the document.\\nBy 90 days maybe it's only 5%.\\n\\nYou can also measure the training programs\\nyour new hires go through by conducting\\npre and post-training tests.\\nIf you have online learning platforms\\nyou can also see how people interact with the training.\\nYou can measure self-efficacy through self-assessments.\\nI suggest asking employees to rate themselves\\non how well they can solve difficult problems,\\nmight handle unexpected situations,\\nand perform various job tasks.\\nKeep your survey short and sweet.\\n\\nYou can measure social integration by reviewing\\na new hire's interaction with social networks,\\nlooking at click rate of new hires in your emails,\\nor doing an online search to see what\\nthe new hire is saying about you online.\\nYou could also ask the manager to rate\\nwhether they believe the new hire is integrating\\nsuccessfully by providing a short rating tool.\\nThe manager can rate whether the new hire speaks up\\nin staff meetings or joins the team for lunch, for example.\\nI recommend measuring cultural integration\\nthrough a short self-assessment.\\n\\nAssuming you have taught the new hire\\nall about your company history, core values,\\nand culture, you can provide a quiz\\nto see what the new hire knows about all these things.\\nRetention rate is a great KPI for your onboarding program.\\nDivide the number of employees who were employed\\nfor the entire measurement period\\nby the number of employees at the start of it.\\nOnly include those who were employed\\non the first and last day of your measurement period.\\nIf you started last year, for example,\\nwith 50 employees and three quit,\\nthen you'd divide 47 by 50, which is 94%.\\n\\n94% retention is pretty great, good job.\\nOf course lots of things can inspire people to leave,\\nso it's useful for understanding onboarding effectiveness,\\nbut it's not the end all, be all.\\nOnboarding satisfaction surveys are another good KPI.\\nNew hires can rate the quality of assistance\\nthey receive from their manager and peers,\\nhow accessible their supervisor has been,\\nand whether they feel prepared to work independently.\\nYou could also ask:\\nWhat aspects of working here excite you?\\nWhat aspects worry you?\\nAnd other open-ended questions to get some useful,\\nqualitative data.\\n\\nDon't forget to measure manager satisfaction\\nwith onboarding too.\\nSince they are a big part of your onboarding program,\\nthey should be feeling satisfied with its usefulness.\\nYou can learn that through a survey you create for

strategically\\nis through management by objectives.\\nIt's focused on improving performance of an organization\\nby translating organizational goals into individual goals.\\nIf your organization wants to open up a new location,\\nmany people will be involved in that endeavor,\\nand those people can then work with their managers\\nto determine objectives related to that goal.\\n\\nThe training manager will have objectives\\naround training the new people in that new office\\nand the accounting assistant will have objectives\\naround paying those new hires.\\nThese employees can now be measured against\\nwhether they achieve their goals,\\nwhich in turn allows the organization to meet its goal.\\nYou should also be measuring training effectiveness\\nand how training ties to

employees.\\nIf the latter is a bigger percentage,\\nyou've got some work to do in promoting from within.\\nOf course, the most obvious measure\\nin growth and productivity is your\\nannual

[Instructor] In HR, your number one\\ncustomer is your employees.\\nJust as your customer service department measures\\nits efforts in customer satisfaction\\nand retention, you must measure yours.\\nSo let's take a look at what you can measure.\\nAverage tenure is the average length\\nof time employees stay at your company,\\nand allows you to gauge employee satisfaction\\nand onboarding effectiveness, as well\\nas predict when people will leave.\\nAdd up the number of months employees stay,\\nthen divide by the number of current employees.\\n\\nIf you currently have 75 employees,\\nand between all of them, the number\\nof months with you is 2700, you would divide\\nthat by 75, which is 36 months.\\nNow, you can create plans for employees\\nthat kick in at the 30-month mark,\\nperhaps, if your goal is to get people to stay longer.\\nPerhaps a bonus is offered at the end\\nof 48 months to get people to stay for another year.\\nTurnover rate is probably one you're already calculating,\\nwhich is the number of leavers divided\\nby the number of people employed\\nduring your chosen timeframe.\\n\\nIf you had 175 employees on January 1,\\nand 25 left over the course of the year,\\nyour turnover rate would be 14%.\\nVoluntary turnover rate is the number\\nof employee resignations divided\\nby the number of employees during your chosen timeframe.\\nIf you want to look at this number,\\nquarter over quarter, let's say 15 people left last quarter\\nand you had 150 employees total during that time.\\nMultiply that by 100 and you've got a rate of 10%.\\n\\nYou can drill down a little more\\nand look at the voluntary turnover rate\\nof high and low potentials.\\nLet's say you have a grid based\\non potential and performance.\\nThose with high potential and high performance\\nare obviously people you don't want leaving.\\nThose with low performance and low potential\\nare easy to say goodbye to.\\nIf you have managers rate employees using this grid\\nas part of the performance process,\\nyou can then run the turnover\\ncalculations inside these categories.\\n\\nIf high potentials are leaving, you've got\\nto figure out how to keep them.\\nOpposite of turnover, you can determine retention rate\\nas a way to measure effectiveness of onboarding.\\nYou might also try measuring retention rate by manager.\\nYou may remember from a previous video,\\nwe'll divide the number of employees who\\nwere employed for the entire measurement period\\nby the number of employees at the start of it.\\nSo if we look at specific managers,\\nlet's say one has 50 employees,\\nand three quit in the last six months.\\n\\nThen you divide 47 by 50 and get 94%.\\nAnother manager has 65 employees,\\nand seven quit in the last six months,\\nthen divide 58 by 65, and get 89%.\\nYou may want to look at that second manager's team,\\nprocesses, and management skills\\nto determine what's going on.\\nThere are some other cool ways to predict\\nwhether people will stay, such as\\nby the percentage of vacation days used.\\n\\nJust divide the total number used\\nby the total number available.\\nSo between your 75 employees, who each 10 days\\na year, you have 750 vacation days.\\nIf so far this year, 600 have been used,\\nyour percentage is 80%.\\nIf it's only July, you've got\\nan employee engagement problem,\\nand I bet you also have high turnover.\\nIf it's December, you've got a work-life balance problem,\\nand risk employee burnout.\\nEither way, you can develop plans to solve your problem.\\n\\nThe Net Promoter Score can be determined\\nby asking one simple question in your employee surveys.\\nHow likely are you to recommend working here\\nto a friend or colleague?\\nIf all 75 employees respond, and 10\\nare in the zero to six range, considered detractors,\\n20 in the seven to eight range, considered neutral,\\nand 45 in the nine to 10 range, considered promoters,\\nthen subtract the number of detractors\\nfrom promoters, or 10 from 45,\\nand your NPS is 35.\\n\\nIs that good or bad?\\nWell, it's just a benchmark.\\nSo next time you run the survey,\\nyou can determine if the number\\nis improving or getting worse, and then try\\nto understand why through follow-up questions.\\nOf course, a simple employee engagement survey\\ncan help you predict retention.\\nLow engagement survey scores likely mean\\npeople aren't producing, and probably\\nlooking elsewhere for work.\\nA work-life balance survey will also help\\nyou measure engagement and satisfaction,\\nas well as the number of employee suggestions\\nreceived in your suggestion program,\\nor average number of suggestions per employee.\\n\\nThe number of employees who participate\\nin nomination programs for awards,\\nor number of participants in parties\\nand events, are also useful.\\nAnywhere you can measure engagement\\nand participation is going to be useful.\\nSo, figure out what's most important\\nto you and start measuring.\\nOnce you understand where you are with things,\\nyou can start working on improving them.\\nFrom there, you can start tying\\nengagement to organizational

satisfaction with those programs.\\n\\nI also recommend measuring diversity in your organization.\\nYou can look at personnel files to determine age,\\nfor example, and add up the ages of all of your employees,\\nthen divide by the number of employees.\\nThis is important for diversity purposes\\nbut also to look at succession planning,\\nforecasting future staffing needs,\\nand calculating cost of benefits for your organization.\\nYou can also measure percentage of females\\nor other groups in management\\nor percentage of veterans employed.\\n\\nRevenue per employee shows the efficiency\\nof the organization.\\nIt is the total company revenue\\ndivided by the current number of employees.\\nObviously, the higher the number per employee the better,\\nand comparing your

which are hard to quantify.\\nLet's say you're going to propose an initiative\\nfocused on employee engagement.\\nCosts include actual costs,\\nbut also time spent from you developing the program,\\ntime spent by managers learning the program, and so forth.\\nBenefits might include increased customer service,\\nbut how do you quantify that?\\nYou'll need to research others in your industry\\nwho implemented engagement\\nand find out how much revenue per employee increased\\nor if handling time per customer went down and so forth.\\n\\nAll you can do in these situations\\nis develop some dollar amounts that make sense to you\\nand then talk to your colleagues and get feedback\\nand settle on some numbers.\\nIt is subjective, but it's more likely to get support\\nif you can back up your program with real numbers\\nthat explain how you came to those numbers.\\nIn the end, you can measure almost anything\\nand the same goes for HR efficiency.\\nOf course, don't measure things\\nfor the sake of measuring them.\\nMeasure the things that will get your leaders'

 \\n For example, in several organizations,  \\n cloud has emerged as a key priority,  \\n and that's where the growth is.  \\n Ask yourself this, which roles are critical  \\n to deliver on the cloud priority?  \\n This takes us to step two, clarify current roles and skills.  \\n Once you identify the area or priority to focus on,  \\n then you can clarify the roles and needed skills.  \\n We will continue with the cloud priority,  \\n and you have determined the most critical role  \\n to ensure you can deliver as a solutions architect.  \\n What skills do solutions architect need to succeed?  \\n Solutions architecture, software development lifecycle,  \\n software project management, cloud computing,  \\n and requirements analysis.  \\n Now you can see some of these skills might exist  \\n outside the solutions architect's role.  \\n For instance, certain project managers in your organization  \\n may already have software project management, SDLC,  \\n and requirements analysis skills from their experience.  \\n Let's move on to the next step,  \\n step three, map out future roles and skills.  \\n How many solutions architects do you currently have  \\n in the organization?  \\n Let's say you have 50 now and you need 100  \\n to deliver on the cloud priority by next year.  \\n You'll have to figure out how to close the gap of 50  \\n plus potential attrition from the current 50  \\n using hiring or training in the next and final step.  \\n Occasionally you'll find that you actually need skills  \\n that don't exist anywhere in the organization today.  \\n That doesn't mean no one has some of the skills  \\n to do the role.  \\n Cloud security manager may be a critical role  \\n for the strategy to be successful,  \\n and maybe there isn't anyone  \\n who is in cloud security today,  \\n but are there security managers  \\n who can quickly learn cloud security  \\n and get trained fast enough to do the role?  \\n This is why it's important  \\n to know what skills employees have,  \\n so you know who has some of the fundamental skills  \\n and can be upskilled quickly.  \\n I'll share another example.  \\n In the AI space, the human-bot coordinator is a role  \\n that companies may need in the near future,  \\n but it doesn't exist today.  \\n Coordination and effective communication are both skills  \\n that a human-bot coordinator will need  \\n and likely already exists in a organization  \\n among project managers, for instance.  \\n This takes us to the final step,  \\n step four, gap-closing action plans.  \\n How will you close the gap of 50 solutions architects?  \\n Let's say you have 50 project managers  \\n in the organization who have software project management,  \\n SDLC, and requirements analysis skills.  \\n If some of them also have cloud computing skills,  \\n they may be prime candidates to be quickly upskilled  \\n to be solutions architects by next year.  \\n Once you determine how long it takes  \\n to close the skills gap for those project managers,  \\n you can then fill the rest of the gap externally via hiring.  \\n Keep in mind, hiring is also not instant,  \\n and some of these technical rules may take three  \\n to six months to fill, so you'll want to plan ahead.  \\n If you're new to this, it may seem daunting.  \\n Don't worry.  \\n We will cover these concepts in much greater detail  \\n in the next chapter of measurements.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4484648\",\"duration\":168,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"What skills are required of everyone in the future\",\"fileName\":\"3268125_en_US_01_03_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"You will learn how to identify core skills that are needed for your workforce.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5801863,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] According to the World Economic Forum,  \\n learned skills generally have a half-life  \\n of about five years.  \\n With more technical skills at just two and a half years  \\n in an IBM study.  \\n The short shelf life of technical skills  \\n requires a continuous re-skilling effort to stay relevant.  \\n How can you prepare yourself  \\n and your organization for the future  \\n when skills are constantly evolving?

 \\n What is a business problem versus an HR problem  \\n that senior leaders may consider as too HR focused?  \\n In general, a business problem has a clear top line  \\n or bottom line impact if not resolved.  \\n For instance, having a sales team that isn't proficient  \\n in negotiations means leaving money on the table in deals.  \\n Understanding who are experts in negotiations  \\n and who need additional development on the sales team  \\n allows you to create a strategy to upscale appropriately.  \\n An HR problem, on the other hand,  \\n only has indirect impact on a business top or bottom line.  \\n A 10% increase in employee engagement, for instance,  \\n while it's understood to be important for the business,  \\n might not have a clear financial impact  \\n without additional analysis.  \\n Once if aligned with the senior leaders  \\n on the problem to solve, like lack of negotiation skills  \\n on the sales team impacting profit margins,  \\n then you can proceed to step two.  \\n In step two, you'll get buy-in from employees  \\n and managers on the data-gathering process.  \\n This is often the step  \\n where I've seen organizations stumble.  \\n What sets successful organizations apart  \\n is having a crystal clear what's in it for me  \\n for everyone who needs to take time off their day to assess,  \\n report, and validate skills.  \\n How will employees and managers benefit  \\n from providing good quality data on skills?  \\n Will it help them get opportunities or pay increases?  \\n Will it help them get promoted faster?  \\n If there's no what's in it for me clearly articulated,  \\n the data-gathering process will become yet another task.  \\n A good what's in it for me may look like:  \\n \\\"We use the data to find development opportunities  \\n suited for you that can prepare you for roles  \\n we know will be in high demand within the company next year.  \\n This means more internal opportunities,  \\n including promotions.\\\"  \\n Employees might not trust HR in gathering data,  \\n and this is where it's important to build trust  \\n at the beginning.  \\n As a result, I'd recommend this type of ask  \\n not come directly from HR or learning development  \\n but instead from management directly.  \\n The third step is getting manager buy-in  \\n for helping with validation of skills  \\n as well as how to use that data.  \\n One question I receive often  \\n is whether to have employees self assess the skills  \\n or have managers assess them.  \\n In a world where time is unlimited, I suggest both.  \\n But often it's unrealistic, so companies have to opt  \\n for either self-reported or manager-assessed data.  \\n Depending on the type of skills,  \\n a manager or employee may be a better judge.  \\n Ultimately, the objective is to have high-quality data.  \\n So think about whether employees or managers  \\n would be a better assessor in this step.  \\n You can also designate SMEs to sign off  \\n on more technical skills.  \\n The point is not all skills are created equal.  \\n There is no one size fits all for gathering skills data.  \\n If you are requiring managers to do the assessment  \\n of employee skills, you'll need to share  \\n the what's in it for me with them.  \\n Why would I spend time to ensure the quality  \\n of skills data is good rather than completing it  \\n to check the box?

 \\n Specifically, if you currently have 100 front-end  \\n and 100 back-end developers and the ratio  \\n for next year needs to be four to one instead,  \\n how can you achieve this goal?  \\n It will certainly depend on  \\n whether there are back-end developers who can do  \\n the front-end development or can quickly be upskilled  \\n If they can be quickly upskilled within a few months,  \\n the solution might be to put together a training boot camp  \\n for the 60 back-end developers  \\n so there will be a total of 160 front-end  \\n and 40 back-end developers as required by the organization.  \\n On the other hand, if the upskilling will take longer  \\n than a few months, the organization may have to  \\n lay off the 60 back-end developers who are not  \\n going to be needed next year.  \\n In this scenario,  \\n we're assuming no attrition for simplicity.  \\n In reality, you will need to account for the number  \\n of front and back-end developers who will resign  \\n or retire within the next year  \\n so you don't end up laying off too many employees.  \\n For instance, if the voluntary attrition rate  \\n for back-end developers is 30%, you'll end up  \\n with 70 back-end developers in a year,  \\n which means you'll lay off 30  \\n instead of 60 backend developers  \\n in anticipation of losing 30 through voluntary attrition.  \\n One way to figure out  \\n whether upskilling will take a long time is by looking  \\n at the extent of overlapping skills between roles.  \\n The higher the overlap in skill sets between two roles,  \\n the higher the chance  \\n for you to succeed in using temporary reassignments.  \\n How do you know the extent to which skill sets  \\n between two distinct roles overlap?

like it sounds, like a golf game scorecard\\nyou will lay out the key result areas and indicators,\\nand then measure your ability to reach them.\\nNow let's look at some vocabulary\\nrelated to metrics themselves.\\n\\nHR analytics is the process of correlating business data\\nand people data to show the impact HR has\\non an organization and drive business decisions.\\nIt's about using metrics to improve people performance,\\nso leaders can improve the organization's performance.\\nPredictive analytics is the practice\\nof extracting information from your data\\nin order to predict

personality traits\\nbest suit a leader in your company,\\nor when people might leave, for example.\\nBig data refers to sets of data that can be analyzed\\nto reveal patterns, trends, and associations.\\nSimply, if you're measuring a bunch of different things\\nand loading them into one place where you can analyze\\nhow all that information interacts,\\nthen you'd be working with big data.\\nIn measuring and analyzing initiatives\\nyou'll need to come up with a research hypothesis\\nbefore crunching the numbers.\\n\\nA hypothesis is a statement that speculates the outcome.\\nFor example, you might hypothesize\\nthat attendance at a customer service training\\nwill increase customer satisfaction scores.\\nYou can then look at attendance in the training,\\nor interaction with the online course,\\ncompared to survey scores and see if you were right.\\nBut, you might also factor in categorical variables,\\nsuch as length of employment, or level in the organization,\\nand other things that could make a difference\\nin how people take in the information.\\n\\nYou might also look at binary variables,\\nor those that only have two categories,\\nsuch as whether they attended the training or not,\\nthe answer is only either yes or no.\\nNominal variables name three or more distinct entities.\\nFor example, you could measure if the same training\\naffected customer satisfaction scores differently\\nin your US office, Australia office, and Canada office.\\nA dependent variable is the one you are measuring.\\n\\nIn our example, customer satisfaction scores\\nare what you're trying to understand, right?\\nYou want to know if training increases them,\\nbut you could also look at whether work hours effects them,\\nlength of hire effects them, and other things.\\nAll of those other things are your independent variables.\\nAs you can see, the question becomes much more\\nthan simply did attendance increase scores?\\nYou can dive into the data\\nand learn all sorts of cool things\\nand then, act accordingly.\\n\\nAnd if a strategic business goal is to increase revenue,\\na key result area related to that\\nis increased customer

fill is high,\\nit could be a result of where you're looking\\nor that your process is too long.\\nSo let's look at source of hire.\\nIf you have an applicant tracking software,\\nthen you're all set, as each candidate is tagged\\nwith source of entry.\\nIf you don't, you'll have to ask candidates\\nhow they learned about the job\\nand keep track of it manually.\\n\\nEither way, once you understand\\nwhere you're most successful,\\nyou can allocate resources to those areas\\nand ensure the best ROI.\\nYou can also try to understand\\nwhy some areas work better than others\\nand if it makes sense to change your strategies.\\nQuality of hire is also important to consider\\nwhen looking at source of hire.\\nYou might get 25 people from one job board\\nand 15 from LinkedIn.\\nBut if the quality is better on LinkedIn,\\nthen that may be where you want to focus your efforts.\\n\\nQuality of hire measures the value\\nnew hires bring to the company.\\nIt includes job performance and productivity\\nwithin a given time,\\nengagement, cultural fit,\\nand turnover of new hires.\\nOf course, some of this is subjective,\\nso let's look at ways to reduce that subjectivity.\\nConsider

hires using your KPIs.\\nI put an example in the exercise file for you,\\nbut you have to really look at each position you're filling\\nand determine what KPIs mean for each.\\nFor performance, you might ask managers\\nto rate how well the new hire is performing X, Y, and Z.\\nFor ramp-up time, ask them to mark\\nhow long it took before those tasks\\nwere being performed well.\\nEngagement, on the other hand,\\nmight be measured by a short survey you give the new hire.\\n\\nCultural fit might be viewed\\nas whether the new hire is socializing\\nor integrating into the work team.\\nKeep it simple, only three to five\\nindicators for each category.\\nThen, input these numbers in your quality of hire formula.\\nJob performance plus ramp-up time\\nplus engagement plus cultural fit\\ndivided by the four factors.\\nSo using the scores your manager\\nmay have given this new hire,\\nyou might say average job performance\\non the three KPIs was four out of five, or 80%.\\n\\nAverage ramp-up time was also four out of five, or 80%.\\nBased on the five question engagement survey\\nyou provided the new hire, engagement is 95%.\\nAnd the manager measured cultural fit at 90%.\\nDivide that by four and the quality of hire score is 86%.\\nFrom there, you can determine how well you did\\noverall for the year.\\nAs an example, let's say you hired 20 people\\nand five of them did not stay on.\\n\\nAnd let's say you've decided\\nthat your target quality per hire score for individuals\\nor acceptable productivity is 80%.\\nNow let's look at the math.\\nThe average quality per hire score for all 20 is 85%.\\n13 out of the 15 who stayed\\nare at the acceptable productivity of 80%,\\nso that's 87%.\\nAnd since five left, your retention rate is 75%.\\nDivide that by three.\\n\\nYour average quality of hire is 82% for the year.\\nYou may be able to find an industry\\nquality of hire number to compare yourself to,\\nbut, at the very least,\\nyou can benchmark your own quality of hire score\\nyear over year or quarter over quarter.\\nCost per hire looks at all the expenses\\ninvolved in hiring a new employee\\nand demonstrates the value\\nof your systems and recruiting venues.\\nUnderstanding the cost per hire\\ncan help you eliminate costs\\nor inspire you to try new venues\\nthat might work better for your business.\\n\\nCost per hire is the total external costs\\nplus total internal costs\\ndivided by the number of hires.\\nYou'll have to spend some time brainstorming costs.\\nExternal costs include fees for posting ads\\nor using agencies, expenses for recruiting,\\nassessments, and background checks.\\nInternal costs might include any software you use,\\ndevelopment cost of the recruiting team,\\nor bonuses you pay to employees for referrals.\\n\\nOne last metric I suggest is candidate satisfaction.\\nUsing a short survey, you can determine\\nif your recruiting process is pleasant\\nand contributes to a positive employer brand.\\nIn the end, keep in mind that all of these steps are related\\nCost per hire can be affected by onboarding\\nand onboarding can be affected by quality of hire\\nand quality of hire can be affected by source of hire.\\nKeep track of the metrics I've outlined here,\\nas well as others that are of interest to you,\\nand then you can see how they all relate,\\nwhat's working and not, and, most importantly,\\nprove your value to your leadership team.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:692254\",\"duration\":318,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Measuring onboarding

I'm positive you have an employee orientation program.\\nIt involves getting paperwork signed,\\nintroducing new hires around the office,\\nand some initial training.\\nBut are you onboarding employees?\\nOnboarding programs are focused on helping new hires\\nadjust to the social and cultural aspects of your company,\\nwhich in turn helps new hires become\\nmore productive more quickly.\\nMeasuring onboarding is indeed important.\\nThe less effective your onboarding,\\nthe more likely someone is to leave.\\n\\nEffective onboarding programs achieve four things.\\nRole clarity: employees understand\\ntheir role and expectations.\\nSelf-efficacy: employees feel confident\\nin their ability to perform.\\nSocial integration: employees feel connected\\nto their new peers.\\nKnowledge of culture: employees understand\\npolicies and history of the company\\nbut also the values and unsaid social rules.\\nOur onboarding measurements need to be\\nfocused in these areas.\\n\\nLet's start with role clarity.\\nThe best metric here is time to proficiency,\\nor the length of time it takes for a new hire\\nto reach full productivity.\\nYou can measure this through quizzes that assess\\nknowledge and skills, observation,\\nor asking managers to score proficiency\\nof a variety of job tasks at various intervals.\\nYou could also ask managers to check off\\njob competencies they observe the new hire demonstrate,\\nand when they demonstrated them.\\n\\nLet's say the new hire has 15 job competencies\\nand the manager notices within the first week\\nthe new hire has two of them down pat.\\nThen at the end of week two the new hire\\nseems to have mastered one more, and so forth.\\nBy keeping track of when what was mastered,\\nthe manager can see time to proficiency\\nand where problems are along the way.\\nNow you can adjust training as needed.\\nYou can also average the information out\\nfor all of your new hires\\nto see where there are gaps in your onboarding processes.\\n\\nYou can also measure new hires against\\nkey performance indicators or KPIs.\\nLet's say you hire a new HR assistant\\nand one task is developing training workbooks.\\nYou can develop at least one KPI for this task\\nand measure her against it at 30, 60, and 90 days.\\nA KPI might be that they require minimal revision from you.\\nAt 30 days you might have to revise 50% of the document.\\nBy 90 days maybe it's only 5%.\\n\\nYou can also measure the training programs\\nyour new hires go through by conducting\\npre and post-training tests.\\nIf you have online learning platforms\\nyou can also see how people interact with the training.\\nYou can measure self-efficacy through self-assessments.\\nI suggest asking employees to rate themselves\\non how well they can solve difficult problems,\\nmight handle unexpected situations,\\nand perform various job tasks.\\nKeep your survey short and sweet.\\n\\nYou can measure social integration by reviewing\\na new hire's interaction with social networks,\\nlooking at click rate of new hires in your emails,\\nor doing an online search to see what\\nthe new hire is saying about you online.\\nYou could also ask the manager to rate\\nwhether they believe the new hire is integrating\\nsuccessfully by providing a short rating tool.\\nThe manager can rate whether the new hire speaks up\\nin staff meetings or joins the team for lunch, for example.\\nI recommend measuring cultural integration\\nthrough a short self-assessment.\\n\\nAssuming you have taught the new hire\\nall about your company history, core values,\\nand culture, you can provide a quiz\\nto see what the new hire knows about all these things.\\nRetention rate is a great KPI for your onboarding program.\\nDivide the number of employees who were employed\\nfor the entire measurement period\\nby the number of employees at the start of it.\\nOnly include those who were employed\\non the first and last day of your measurement period.\\nIf you started last year, for example,\\nwith 50 employees and three quit,\\nthen you'd divide 47 by 50, which is 94%.\\n\\n94% retention is pretty great, good job.\\nOf course lots of things can inspire people to leave,\\nso it's useful for understanding onboarding effectiveness,\\nbut it's not the end all, be all.\\nOnboarding satisfaction surveys are another good KPI.\\nNew hires can rate the quality of assistance\\nthey receive from their manager and peers,\\nhow accessible their supervisor has been,\\nand whether they feel prepared to work independently.\\nYou could also ask:\\nWhat aspects of working here excite you?\\nWhat aspects worry you?\\nAnd other open-ended questions to get some useful,\\nqualitative data.\\n\\nDon't forget to measure manager satisfaction\\nwith onboarding too.\\nSince they are a big part of your onboarding program,\\nthey should be feeling satisfied with its usefulness.\\nYou can learn that through a survey you create for them too.\\nOne big tip for ensuring success of onboarding:\\nput time in your schedule to meet with new hires regularly\\nand ensure that your managers are doing the

produced,\\nnumber of sales,\\nhow often customers buy twice or more,\\nor handling time for customers.\\nReally, you can measure anything your employees are doing.\\nYou just have to figure out what it is\\nand how to measure it.\\n\\nOnce you start measuring things,\\nyou can determine where more training is needed\\nor where processes need to be improved.\\nOne way to measure performance strategically\\nis through management by objectives.\\nIt's focused on improving performance of an organization\\nby translating organizational goals into individual goals.\\nIf your organization wants to open up a new location,\\nmany people will be involved in that endeavor,\\nand those people can then work with their managers\\nto determine objectives related to that goal.\\n\\nThe training manager will have objectives\\naround training the new people in that new office\\nand the accounting assistant will have objectives\\naround paying those new hires.\\nThese employees can now be measured against\\nwhether they achieve their goals,\\nwhich in turn allows the organization to meet its goal.\\nYou should also be measuring training effectiveness\\nand how training ties to organizational goals.\\nUsing your new location example,\\nlet's say the training manager is tasked\\nwith ensuring all new hires have an average performance\\nof 80% within two months of opening the doors,\\nand 90% within three.\\n\\nYou and the training manager would develop\\nKPIs for each position and then focus training around them.\\nAnother metric to look at is promotion rate.\\nSimply divide the number of promotions\\nin a given timeframe by your total number of employees.\\nAlso look at the number of people hired in\\nat management level and divide that\\nby your total number of employees.\\nIf the latter is a bigger percentage,\\nyou've got some work to do in promoting from within.\\nOf course, the most obvious measure\\nin growth and productivity is your\\nannual performance evaluation.\\n\\nYour managers should absolutely be trained\\non how to use your measurement tool,\\nand then you can measure people's performance and growth.\\nAfter performance conversations are over,\\nlook at the average scores for employees\\nwithin each department and determine which departments\\nneed more employee training or which managers\\nneed more management training.\\nMy biggest tip in the end: measure whatever you can.\\nDetermine how to improve and identify\\nwhat impact HR has on the bottom line with strategic goals.\\n\\nThis is how you become a

[Instructor] In HR, your number one\\ncustomer is your employees.\\nJust as your customer service department measures\\nits efforts in customer satisfaction\\nand retention, you must measure yours.\\nSo let's take a look at what you can measure.\\nAverage tenure is the average length\\nof time employees stay at your company,\\nand allows you to gauge employee satisfaction\\nand onboarding effectiveness, as well\\nas predict when people will leave.\\nAdd up the number of months employees stay,\\nthen divide by the number of current employees.\\n\\nIf you currently have 75 employees,\\nand between all of them, the number\\nof months with you is 2700, you would divide\\nthat by 75, which is 36 months.\\nNow, you can create plans for employees\\nthat kick in at the 30-month mark,\\nperhaps, if your goal is to get people to stay longer.\\nPerhaps a bonus is offered at the end\\nof 48 months to get people to stay for another year.\\nTurnover rate is probably one you're already calculating,\\nwhich is the number of leavers divided\\nby the number of people employed\\nduring your chosen timeframe.\\n\\nIf you had 175 employees on January 1,\\nand 25 left over the course of the year,\\nyour turnover rate would be 14%.\\nVoluntary turnover rate is the number\\nof employee resignations divided\\nby the number of employees during your chosen timeframe.\\nIf you want to look at this number,\\nquarter over quarter, let's say 15 people left last quarter\\nand you had 150 employees total during that time.\\nMultiply that by 100 and you've got a rate of 10%.\\n\\nYou can drill down a little more\\nand look at the voluntary turnover rate\\nof high and low potentials.\\nLet's say you have a grid based\\non potential and performance.\\nThose with high potential and high performance\\nare obviously people you don't want leaving.\\nThose with low performance and low potential\\nare easy to say goodbye to.\\nIf you have managers rate employees using this grid\\nas part of the performance process,\\nyou can then run the turnover\\ncalculations inside these categories.\\n\\nIf high potentials are leaving, you've got\\nto figure out how to keep them.\\nOpposite of turnover, you can determine retention rate\\nas a way to measure effectiveness of onboarding.\\nYou might also try measuring retention rate by manager.\\nYou may remember from a previous video,\\nwe'll divide the number of employees who\\nwere employed for the entire measurement period\\nby the number of employees at the start of it.\\nSo if we look at specific managers,\\nlet's say one has 50 employees,\\nand three quit in the last six months.\\n\\nThen you divide 47 by 50 and get 94%.\\nAnother manager has 65 employees,\\nand seven quit in the last six months,\\nthen divide 58 by 65, and get 89%.\\nYou may want to look at that second manager's team,\\nprocesses, and management skills\\nto determine what's going on.\\nThere are some other cool ways to predict\\nwhether people will stay, such as\\nby the percentage of vacation days used.\\n\\nJust divide the total number used\\nby the total number available.\\nSo between your 75 employees, who each 10 days\\na year, you have 750 vacation days.\\nIf so far this year, 600 have been used,\\nyour percentage is 80%.\\nIf it's only July, you've got\\nan employee engagement problem,\\nand I bet you also have high turnover.\\nIf it's December, you've got a work-life balance problem,\\nand risk employee burnout.\\nEither way, you can develop plans to solve your problem.\\n\\nThe Net Promoter Score can be determined\\nby asking one simple question in your employee surveys.\\nHow likely are you to recommend working here\\nto a friend or colleague?\\nIf all 75 employees respond, and 10\\nare in the zero to six range, considered detractors,\\n20 in the seven to eight range, considered neutral,\\nand 45 in the nine to 10 range, considered promoters,\\nthen subtract the number of detractors\\nfrom promoters, or 10 from 45,\\nand your NPS is 35.\\n\\nIs that good or bad?\\nWell, it's just a benchmark.\\nSo next time you run the survey,\\nyou can determine if the number\\nis improving or getting worse, and then try\\nto understand why through follow-up questions.\\nOf course, a simple employee engagement survey\\ncan help you predict retention.\\nLow engagement survey scores likely mean\\npeople aren't producing, and probably\\nlooking elsewhere for work.\\nA work-life balance survey will also help\\nyou measure engagement and satisfaction,\\nas well as the number of employee suggestions\\nreceived in your suggestion program,\\nor average number of suggestions per employee.\\n\\nThe number of employees who participate\\nin nomination programs for awards,\\nor number of participants in parties\\nand events, are also useful.\\nAnywhere you can measure engagement\\nand participation is going to be useful.\\nSo, figure out what's most important\\nto you and start measuring.\\nOnce you understand where you are with things,\\nyou can start working on improving them.\\nFrom there, you can start tying\\nengagement to organizational

far, we've been looking at metrics\\nbased on the employee life cycle.\\nSo let's shift gears and look at other metrics\\nspecifically related to HR functioning.\\nOne important metric is HR-to-staff ratio.\\nA good average to shoot for is three full-time HR people\\nper 100 employees.\\nOther metrics involve the time to accomplish different tasks\\nsuch as time to process payroll or vacation time\\nand time to respond to email inquiries from employees.\\nYou could also look at the number of calls\\nand types of inquiries you receive about certain programs\\nsuch as benefits to determine how well\\nyou are communicating about them.\\n\\nIf you get a lot of inquiries,\\nperhaps you need to rework your marketing.\\nSpeaking of benefits,\\nyou could also measure benefit program cost per

satisfaction with HR.\\nCheck out the exercise file\\nfor a sample HR satisfaction survey.\\nBe sure to include all of your programs and benefits\\nand ask people to rate the quality of\\nor satisfaction with those programs.\\n\\nI also recommend measuring diversity in your organization.\\nYou can look at personnel files to determine age,\\nfor example, and add up the ages of all of your employees,\\nthen divide by the number of employees.\\nThis is important for diversity purposes\\nbut also to look at succession planning,\\nforecasting future staffing needs,\\nand calculating cost of benefits for your organization.\\nYou can also measure percentage of females\\nor other groups in management\\nor percentage of veterans employed.\\n\\nRevenue per employee shows the efficiency\\nof the organization.\\nIt is the total company revenue\\ndivided by the current number of employees.\\nObviously, the higher the number per employee the better,\\nand comparing your number to others in your industry\\noffers a clue as to whether you company should consider\\ncutting expenses or find ways to earn more per employee\\nwithout forcing them to work 80 hours a week of course.\\nLet's also look at measuring the return on investment,\\nor ROI of HR programs.\\n\\nSimply, ROI is the total benefit minus the total costs.\\nFor example, if you invest in a $1,000 coaching program\\nfor your employees to increase their sales\\nand factor in the $10,000 costs of time spent\\nin the program and the learning curve,\\nand they bring in $40,000 as a direct result of the program,\\nyour ROI is $30,000, or 75%.\\nWhen determining ROI of an initiative,\\nyou will be proposing to leadership.\\n\\nIt's important to think about all of the costs and benefits,\\nsome of which are hard to quantify.\\nLet's say you're going to propose an initiative\\nfocused on employee engagement.\\nCosts include actual costs,\\nbut also time spent from you developing the program,\\ntime spent by managers learning the program, and so forth.\\nBenefits might include increased customer service,\\nbut how do you quantify that?\\nYou'll need to research others in your industry\\nwho implemented engagement\\nand find out how much revenue per employee increased\\nor if handling time per customer went down and so forth.\\n\\nAll you can do in these situations\\nis develop some dollar amounts that make sense to you\\nand then talk to your colleagues and get feedback\\nand settle on some numbers.\\nIt is subjective, but it's more likely to get support\\nif you can back up your program with real numbers\\nthat explain how you came to those numbers.\\nIn the end, you can measure almost anything\\nand the same goes for HR efficiency.\\nOf course, don't measure

My first management job was heading up  \\n the capital budgeting team  \\n for an automotive manufacturing group in the Detroit area.  \\n The company was recently acquired,  \\n and I was sent from corporate headquarters  \\n to lead the implementation of a new process  \\n for getting equipment requests approved.  \\n It was not hard to convince people  \\n to go along with the new progress,  \\n since this was the only way to justify  \\n any new equipment purchases.  \\n While this was a CFO-driven and an all-or-nothing way  \\n to overcome resistance to change,  \\n we also helped the engineering teams  \\n in the 15 plants learn how to submit their requests  \\n and get them approved more quickly than before.  \\n This handholding was essential  \\n for getting instant adoption, plus it earned us  \\n some great recommendations as we implemented other changes  \\n into the budgeting process.  \\n The lesson here is that HR will find it easier  \\n to get support from other departments  \\n by first fully understanding the impact  \\n of these changes before advocating the change.  \\n In fact, it's a good idea to get those most affected  \\n by the change to help to develop the solution.  \\n This way, you'll have built-in support,  \\n as well as the proof needed to justify the change.  \\n Another way to get project support  \\n is to show how the change will lead  \\n to significant cost savings, increase revenues,  \\n or improve the efficiency over time.  \\n The A versus B tests provides the real-life examples  \\n and backup needed to make the case compelling and relatable.  \\n For example, a few years ago,  \\n we helped an insurance company justify  \\n a new hiring process for their sales teams  \\n by conducting an A versus B test  \\n to demonstrate the impact of the new approach.  \\n Under the new approach,  \\n the number of new hires making quota increased by 50%  \\n within six months.  \\n Just as important is to describe the potential costs  \\n of not implementing the change,  \\n such as lost opportunities or reduced competitiveness.  \\n For the sales group,  \\n this was on the order of millions of dollars  \\n in revenue per year.  \\n This is a great way for stakeholders  \\n to understand the financial implications of the change  \\n and to increase their willingness to support it.  \\n Another problem HR typically faces  \\n is lack of user training during the implementation process.  \\n I've seen this often when companies implement  \\n a new HRIS system or ATS.  \\n These are not intuitive systems to use  \\n and require a lot of training  \\n to get the new processes to stick.  \\n It's worse when these new systems just automate  \\n an existing process and add extra steps  \\n without getting better results.  \\n In this case, resistance is warranted,  \\n since it takes more effort to get the same output.  \\n Extra support might minimize this resistance,  \\n but the root cause is implementing technology  \\n without first making the necessary process changes.  \\n HR is a function that's generally resistant to change.  \\n It's in their DNA and how HR people get promoted  \\n by being careful, avoiding legal problems,  \\n and being in compliance with all of the rules  \\n and regulations covering the workplace.  \\n So it's doubly difficult when asked to lead change,  \\n since it goes against their very nature.  \\n One way to overcome this is to benchmark  \\n how non-HR change programs were successfully implemented  \\n in your company,  \\n and adopt these concepts as starting points.  \\n However, making this change starts  \\n by thinking differently, not traditionally.  \\n And this might be the most difficult change of all to make.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4526026\",\"duration\":193,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Calculate the financial impact for change\",\"fileName\":\"4470526_en_US_02_04_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":719,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"use take 01\\ntwo passes in TK01, use second pass.\\nthere are two pickups at end of TK01.\\nall of this is documented in storyboards editing notes\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesPickups\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"hasSlides\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"HR-driven change often falls short due to a lack of appropriate metrics, and understanding how they tie to organizational success.

As an HR leader,  \\n it's important to be aware  \\n of the most common project management models  \\n including agile, waterfall, lean, and hybrid.  \\n You'll be able to quickly figure out  \\n which approach works  \\n best for your change initiative  \\n by first preparing the high level performance objectives  \\n for your project using the OKR format  \\n described earlier in this chapter.  \\n For example, if you want  \\n to upgrade your management training programs  \\n by testing different approaches,  \\n you'll likely want  \\n to consider an agile project management approach.  \\n In this model, projects are broken down into smaller tasks  \\n known as sprints in the world of software development,  \\n with regular reviews  \\n and adjustments as the project progresses.  \\n This approach allows for flexibility  \\n and the ability to modify the program  \\n based on the latest  \\n findings on what works best.  \\n By assessing the impact of each phase,  \\n you'll be able to continuously improve the results  \\n and eventually hone in on the best long-term solution.  \\n Waterfall project management is totally different.  \\n This is the classic project management approach.  \\n It's time and milestone focused following a sequence  \\n of steps with each phase of the project completed  \\n before the next one begins.  \\n This is the model to use when the project scope requirements  \\n and deliverables are well-defined from the outset.  \\n So if your major performance objective requires a completion  \\n of a new HRIS system in 18 months,  \\n a waterfall project management is the best choice.  \\n It's built on clearly defined stages from system selection  \\n to testing to roll out  \\n with defined measurable outcomes at each step.  \\n However, it's important to note that the selection  \\n of the system to use could have been evaluated using some  \\n form of agile project management system  \\n to determine which one best meets your company's needs.  \\n Lean project management, on the other hand,  \\n is focused on reducing costs and increasing productivity.  \\n It emphasized the elimination of unnecessary tasks  \\n and wasted effort while proving end user results.  \\n For example, this approach can be utilized  \\n in streamlining HR processes such  \\n as reducing the steps in the recruitment process.  \\n By eliminating redundant procedures  \\n and re-engineering complex processes,  \\n your company can reduce time to fill while maintaining  \\n or maybe even improving quality of hire at reduced costs.  \\n Hybrid project management, as the name implies,  \\n combine aspects of all of these models  \\n to customize the approach  \\n to meet the project specific requirements.  \\n It allows for flexibility when needed while  \\n maintaining structure where necessary.  \\n A typical HR project suited  \\n to the hybrid model is a company-wide  \\n cultural change initiative.  \\n The planning and definition stages can follow a waterfall  \\n approach to establish clear objectives and metrics.  \\n While the implementation phase could use agile,  \\n allowing iterative refinements based on employee  \\n feedback and engagement levels.  \\n Bottom line, it's pretty clear  \\n that choosing the right project management model can  \\n significantly impact the success of an HR change initiative.  \\n Each model, be it agile with its emphasis on flexibility,  \\n waterfall with its structured progress,  \\n lean with its focus on efficiency,  \\n or hybrid with its blend of approaches has strengths  \\n that make it suitable for specific types of projects.  \\n Understanding these models  \\n and aligning them with your project requirements will help  \\n you successfully implement your change initiative.  \\n And much of this can be figured out  \\n by outlining your change initiative using the OKR framework  \\n described earlier.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4528015\",\"duration\":177,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Develop a flash report to track project status\",\"fileName\":\"4470526_en_US_03_04_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":950,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"inside take 01, there are three passes. \\n- use third pass\\n- don't use 1st or 2nd pass\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesPickups\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"hasSlides\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"A flash report is similar to taking a person\u2019s vital signs whenever going to the doctor\u2019s office.

When it comes to implementing change,  \\n I'm a big fan of benchmarking best practices.  \\n So when I stumbled upon John Kotter's eight step process,  \\n I realized he had already figured it out  \\n and described it in his great book \\\"Leading Change.\\\"  \\n In fact, when I became an executive recruiter,  \\n I naturally started a new search assignment  \\n by asking the hiring manager  \\n to describe the biggest changes a new hire needed to handle.  \\n Knowing that changes required to be successful,  \\n all I had to do is ask candidates  \\n to describe their biggest comparable accomplishments,  \\n determine if they were a reasonable fit for the job.  \\n After interviewing hundreds of candidates this way,  \\n it was clear that the best change leaders  \\n unknowingly followed Kotter's core principles quite closely.  \\n Their collective advice is a good starting point  \\n for any HR leader who wants to benchmark best practices  \\n when implementing major change programs.  \\n Creating a strategic vision of what needs  \\n to get done is the foundation of any change project.  \\n Putting this together involves a lot of pre-work,  \\n including assessing and building the team,  \\n understanding the problem,  \\n and evaluating different alternatives.  \\n From this, a comprehensive plan  \\n of action needs to be created.  \\n Marketing 101 is next on the list of important things to do,  \\n and let me make this point.  \\n It's not HR marketing or intimidation marketing.  \\n It's benefit-based marketing  \\n emphasizing the positive impact  \\n of making the change,  \\n not the cost or legal purpose of making it.  \\n Part of these marketing efforts involves creating  \\n a sense of urgency,  \\n both to get people committed early  \\n to the project  \\n and then to keep them engaged once it's underway.  \\n This is another core Kotter principle  \\n that's often overlooked.  \\n One way to generate and maintain momentum is  \\n by tying the change to a big company project or initiative.  \\n For example, one home builder described to me  \\n how the implementation of a new cost tracking system would  \\n help them become more competitive  \\n by minimizing new home price increases.  \\n This mission got those involved  \\n who were actually doing the work in submitting the new forms  \\n to persevere despite the additional work involved.  \\n Another important way to keep the momentum going is  \\n to celebrate short-term wins.  \\n The key is to be sure to make a big deal when achieving  \\n any critical milestone.  \\n Make sure this is marketed  \\n and applauded with full credit  \\n given to those who did the work.  \\n I'm not sure breaking bottlenecks shouldn't be number one on  \\n Kotter's all time list.  \\n He calls it empower broad-based action.  \\n I call it simply proactive management.  \\n The point here is to give the team leaders authority  \\n to make important decisions when needed,  \\n and just as important is to anticipate  \\n and remove any roadblocks  \\n before they delay or overwhelm a project.  \\n Kotter highlights need to use these change projects as a way  \\n to institutionalize continuous improvement  \\n into a company's culture.  \\n I believe HR leaders can adopt this mindset as well,  \\n including hiring and developing people  \\n for HR leadership positions.  \\n With this type of proactive mindset,  \\n this would be a great step in changing perception  \\n of HR from one that just administers the status quo  \\n into a forward-looking department  \\n that's helping the company become more competitive.  \\n When it comes to benchmarking best change management ideas,  \\n I'd suggest that HR leaders benchmark  \\n the best business leaders,  \\n not just the best HR leaders.  \\n And benchmarking John Kotter is a great way to start.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4525088\",\"duration\":191,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"BEST personality style indicator\",\"fileName\":\"4470526_en_US_04_02_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":608,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"inside take 01, there are two passes. \\n- use second pass\\n- pickup at end of TK01. noted in storyboard\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesPickups\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"hasSlides\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"Metrics and feedback process control are essential for tracking the progress of a complex project and identifying any potential bottlenecks.
